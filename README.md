# HamStudy Technician License HamBook

Welcome to the HamStudy Technician License HamBook project! This open-source book is designed to help aspiring amateur radio operators prepare for their Technician class license exam.

## About the Project

The HamStudy Technician License HamBook is a comprehensive guide covering all aspects of the Technician class amateur radio license exam. It's written in a beginner-friendly, conversational style to make complex topics easy to understand.

Key features:
- In-depth coverage of all exam topics
- Integration with HamStudy.org study tools
- Mixed approach allowing either rapid cramming or in-depth study
- Free and open access to promote accessibility in amateur radio education

The primary goal is to provide a **cohesive** study resource that explains all necessary topics for the Technician license exam. Many other resources focus on **test questions first**—our approach is to teach the concepts so that the questions make sense without overwhelming you with too much information.

## Development Status

While the HamBook covers all necessary topics, it is in **active development**. We're continuously refining and improving the content.

We may add additional license classes in the future, but that is not yet decided.

## How to Use

You can read the HamBook **online for free** at [https://hambook.org](https://hambook.org). The book is designed to work seamlessly with the study tools at HamStudy.org.
