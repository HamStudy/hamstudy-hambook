# HamStudy Technician License HamBook

Welcome to the HamStudy Technician License HamBook project! This open-source book is designed to help aspiring amateur radio operators prepare for their Technician class license exam.

## About the Project

The HamStudy Technician License HamBook is a comprehensive guide covering all aspects of the Technician class amateur radio license exam. It's written in a beginner-friendly, conversational style to make complex topics easy to understand.

Key features:
- In-depth coverage of all exam topics
- Integration with HamStudy.org study tools
- Free and open access to promote accessibility in amateur radio education


The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of all topics needed for the Technician license exam in a cohesive way that holds together. Many other resources are based around test questions primarily – our goal is to have the questions help you to remember the material, but the material should stand on its own without them.

At the same time we are not trying to replace other resources – just provide a more cohesive "getting started" point for people who find jumping right into the question pool to be too much.

## Development Status

While the HamBook covers all necessary topics, it is in active development. We're continuously refining and improving the content to enhance its effectiveness as a study resource.

We may add additional license classes in the future, but that is not decided.

## How to Use

You can read the HamBook online at [https://hambook.org](https://hambook.org). The book is designed to work seamlessly with the study tools at HamStudy.org.
