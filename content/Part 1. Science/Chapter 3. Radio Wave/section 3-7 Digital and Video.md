### Section 3.7: Digital and Video Modes

Welcome to the digital age of amateur radio! If voice modes are like having a conversation, digital modes are like sending text messages or emails through the airwaves. And video? It may surprise you to know that it's been possible to send pictures and television with Amateur Radio for decades!

**Packet Radio**
Imagine sending an email via radio waves. That's essentially what packet radio does! It breaks your message into small "packets" of data, sends them over the air, and then reassembles them at the receiving end. Each packet includes:
- A check sum for error detection
- The call sign of the destination station
- Automatic repeat request if errors are detected

It's like sending a puzzle through the air and having it reassemble itself perfectly on the other side! Packet radio was a big deal in the 1980s and 1990s before the internet became widespread. Today, it's still used in some applications, especially in emergency communications. It's like the sturdy old pickup truck of digital modes - not the fastest, but reliable and gets the job done.

**APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System)**
APRS is like the social media of ham radio. It lets you transmit all sorts of data: your position, weather info, short messages - you name it! Imagine a real-time map showing where hams are operating, complete with status updates. It's super useful for public service events or emergencies, letting coordinators see where their operators are at a glance. With APRS, you can:
- Track your location as you move around
- Set up a home station as a digital signpost
- Share local weather data
- Send short text messages
- View a map showing the locations of other stations

It's like Twitter meets Google Maps, but for radio!

**PSK31**
PSK31 is like the smooth jazz of digital modes. It's designed for real-time, keyboard-to-keyboard conversations. PSK stands for "Phase Shift Keying" and the "31" in its name comes from its bandwidth - just 31 Hz! That's incredibly narrow, allowing it to get through in tough conditions.

**RTTY (RadioTeletype)**
RTTY is the granddaddy of digital modes. It's been around since the 1930s! Think of it as a radio-based typewriter. It's still popular in contests and for some news agencies.

**PACTOR**
PACTOR is like the Swiss Army knife of digital modes. It can automatically switch between speeds and encoding methods based on conditions. There are several versions, with PACTOR III offering robust performance for things like email over radio.

**Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)**
DMR is like the smartphone of the radio world. It's a digital mode that uses time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology. In simple terms, it splits one 12.5 kHz channel into two time slots, allowing two conversations to happen simultaneously. Cool, right? Here's the scoop:
- DMR repeaters use "color codes" instead of PL tones or DCS codes. Your color code must match to access the repeater!
- It organizes users into "talkgroups" - like chat rooms for your radio. Program the group ID or code and you're in!
- The audio quality is super clear, even with weak signals

**SSTV (Slow Scan Television)**
SSTV is like sending a postcard via radio. It transmits still images, taking anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes to send a single picture. You can even receive pictures from the International Space Station!

**FSTV (Fast Scan Television)**
FSTV is full-motion video over the air. Think of it as YouTube for ham radio! It requires a lot of bandwidth, so it's typically used on UHF and higher frequencies. The NTSC (National Television System Committee) standard, which was used for analog TV in North America, is also used in amateur television. It's like having your own TV channel!

That said and as fun as it is, remember that broadcasts intended for the general public are forbidden (See chapter 8!). Any transmissions you make including Amateur Television need to be for an allowed purpose in the Amateur Radio service.

**Mesh Networks**
Mesh networks are like a web of interconnected radios. Each station in a mesh network can receive and relay data, creating a robust, decentralized network. It's based on standard Wi-Fi equipment with custom firmware and relies on the same IEEE 802.11 modes as a traditional wireless network, just modified a bit. Imagine a whole neighborhood linked together, able to communicate even if the internet goes down!

**New Digital Modes**
The world of digital modes is constantly evolving. Modes like FT8 and FT4, developed by Joe Taylor K1JT, have revolutionized weak signal communication. These modes can pull readable signals out of noise levels that would make voice communication impossible.

**ARQ and WSJT-X**
ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) is a clever error correction method. If a receiving station detects an error, it automatically asks for a retransmission. It's like having a built-in "Could you repeat that?" function.

WSJT-X is a software suite that includes modes like FT8 and JT65. These modes are digital weak signal modes, perfect for making contacts when conditions are poor. They support things like moonbounce (EME), meteor scatter, and other weak signal propagation methods.

As a Technician, you have access to many of these digital modes, especially on VHF and UHF bands. They open up a whole new world of possibilities:

1. Experiment with packet radio for emergency communications.
2. Try SSTV to exchange pictures with other hams.
3. Dip your toes into HF digital modes on 10 meters when conditions allow.
4. Set up a simple FSTV station on the UHF bands.
5. Explore DMR for clear digital voice communications.
6. Get involved with your local ham radio mesh network.

Remember, one of the exciting things about ham radio is that it's always evolving. New modes are being developed all the time, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with radio communication.

Whether you're into casual chats, technical experiments, emergency preparedness, or even space communication, there's a digital mode out there for you. It's like having a massive toolbox - each mode is a different tool, suited for different jobs.

So don't be afraid to experiment! Set up your computer, connect it to your radio, and dive into the digital world. You might just find yourself making contacts across the country (or the world) with nothing more than a simple wire antenna and some clever software.

Welcome to the cutting edge of amateur radio - where hobby meets high-tech!
