Imagine you're at a busy train station. You see trains of all shapes and sizes, carrying different types of cargo. Some are sleek passenger trains, others are long freight trains. In the world of radio, our "trains" are carrier waves, and the "cargo" is the information we want to send. The way we load this information onto our carrier wave is called modulation.

Let's explore some common modulation modes you'll encounter as a ham:

**Amplitude Modulation (AM)**
Think of AM like a roller coaster. The carrier wave is the track, and our signal information creates hills and valleys along this track. In AM, we're changing (modulating) the amplitude, or height, of the wave.

AM was the first modulation method used for voice transmission. While it's not as common in amateur radio today, you'll still hear it on broadcast radio and some aircraft communications. Most analog television signals (including most fast scan Amateur Television) use AM.

**Frequency Modulation (FM) and Phase Modulation (PM)**
If AM is a roller coaster, FM is more like a winding road. Instead of changing the height of our wave, we're changing its frequency - making it wiggle faster or slower. PM is similar, but instead of changing the frequency, we're shifting the phase of the signal. I'mma be real here for a minute – hardly any of us think about or even care about the difference between these two. The difference is in how the signal is created, but when receiving it they are so similar that a FM receiver can receive a PM signal and vise versa. We probably wouldn't even bother telling you about PM except it's mentioned in a couple of test questions!

Generally speaking we will only talk about FM – just know that wherever we talk about FM there is a chance that PM might be used instead for reasons that most of us will never need to understand!

FM (or PM) is super popular in amateur radio, especially on VHF and UHF bands. It's one of the simplest and clearest modes to use and is not only used for voice on VHF/UHF but for packet radio as well.


**Single Sideband (SSB)**
Now, let's talk about SSB - it's where amplitude modulation gets a cool upgrade. SSB is actually a form of amplitude modulation, but with a clever twist. Remember our AM roller coaster? Well, SSB is like realizing we can send our message with just half of the track and without the center rail. We've stripped away the carrier (that's the part that makes AM signals "quiet" even when there's no sound) and one of the sidebands. The result? A more efficient signal that uses less bandwidth and power. It's like AM went on a diet and came back leaner and meaner! This efficiency is why SSB is so popular for long-distance voice communications on HF bands. So remember, when someone asks if SSB is a form of amplitude modulation, the answer is a resounding "Yes!" - it's just AM's more sophisticated cousin.

**Single Sideband (SSB)**
Now, SSB is where things get interesting. Remember our AM roller coaster? It turns out we don't need the whole track to send our message. SSB is like removing half of the track and the center rail, leaving just one "side" of our signal. It's still a form of amplitude modulation, but there is no longer any carrier (the part of the signal that makes things quiet when there isn't any sound) and it only uses half of the signal.

There are two flavors of SSB:
- Upper Sideband (USB): Generally used on frequencies above 10 MHz
  - That includes 30, 20, 17, 15, 12, and 10 meters
- Lower Sideband (LSB): Used below 10 MHz
  - That includes 160, 80, and 40 meters

SSB is a ham radio favorite, especially on HF bands. It's more efficient than AM, allowing your signal to go further with less power. It's like upgrading from a steam engine to a bullet train!

**Bandwidth**
Now, let's talk about bandwidth. If our modulated signal is a train, bandwidth is the width of the track it needs. Different modulation types need different amounts of "track space" in the radio spectrum.

Here's a rough guide:
- CW (Morse code): About 150 Hz
- SSB voice: About 3 kHz
- AM voice: About 6 kHz
- FM voice: About 10-15 kHz for narrow band FM used in amateur radio
- AM fast-scan television: About 6 MHz

Why does this matter? Well, the wider your bandwidth, the more "space" you take up in the radio spectrum. A typical single sideband (SSB) voice signal has an approximate bandwidth of 3 kHz vs a typical AM voice signal with an approximate bandwidth of 6 kHz. This is one reason why SSB is often preferred for long-distance communication on HF bands, as it uses less bandwidth than other voice modes like AM.

As a Technician, you'll mostly use FM on VHF and UHF bands. But as you explore the 10 meter HF band, you'll get to try out SSB. And who knows? You might even get bitten by the CW bug and start learning Morse code!

Remember, choosing the right modulation mode is like picking the right tool for the job. FM is great for local communications with high audio quality. SSB lets you stretch out on HF bands, making long-distance contacts with relatively low power. And CW? It's the mode that gets through when all others fail, piercing through noise with its narrow bandwidth.

In ham radio, there's always something new to learn and try. Each mode has its own quirks and charms. As you gain experience, you'll develop your own preferences. Maybe you'll love the clarity of FM, or perhaps you'll be drawn to the DX potential of SSB. The joy of amateur radio is in the exploration!
