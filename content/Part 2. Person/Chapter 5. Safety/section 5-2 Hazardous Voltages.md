### Section 5.2: Hazardous Voltages

Let's talk about the elephant in the room - or rather, the buzz in your shack: hazardous voltages. Now, you might be thinking, "I'm just a Technician. I'm not messing with big amplifiers or anything." But here's the thing: hazardous voltages are sneakier than you might think.

First off, what do we mean by "hazardous voltage"? In the ham radio world, we generally consider anything above 30 volts to be potentially hazardous. That might seem low, but remember, it doesn't take much to give you a nasty shock or worse.

Now, where might you encounter these voltages? More places than you'd expect:

1. Power Supplies: That 13.8V power supply for your radio? Inside, it's converting 120V AC to DC. One wrong move and you could be in for a shock.

2. Antenna Systems: Ever heard of "hot" antennas? Some antennas can develop high voltages at their feed points, especially when transmitting.

3. Older Equipment: If you're lucky enough to play with some vintage gear, be extra cautious. Old tube equipment can have voltages in the hundreds or even thousands of volts!

4. Capacitors: These little storage tanks can hold a charge long after equipment is unplugged. They're like electrical grudge-holders.

Here's a story to keep in mind: A ham I know was working on an old receiver. He'd unplugged it, but didn't discharge the capacitors. One zap later, and he had a newfound respect for those innocuous-looking components!

So, how do we stay safe?

1. Assume everything is "hot" until proven otherwise. Use a voltmeter to check before you touch.

2. Use one hand when working around high voltages. It sounds weird, but it keeps current from flowing across your chest if you do get shocked.

3. Discharge capacitors properly. There are safe ways to do this - learn them before you need them.

4. Keep your workspace dry and use insulated tools.

5. Never work alone on high-voltage equipment. Have a buddy around who knows CPR, just in case.

6. If you're not sure, don't touch it! There's no shame in asking for help or leaving it to the experts.

Remember, the goal is to make contacts, not become one with your equipment. Electricity doesn't care how experienced you are or how careful you think you're being. It'll take any path to ground, including through you if you give it the chance.

But don't let this scare you away from the hobby! With proper respect and precautions, you can safely enjoy all aspects of ham radio. Just remember: when in doubt, hands out!

Stay safe, and keep those electrons where they belong - in your radio, not through your body!
