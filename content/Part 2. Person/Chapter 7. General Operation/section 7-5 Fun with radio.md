### Section 7.5: Fun with Amateur Radio

Alright, radio adventurers, buckle up! We're about to explore some of the coolest, quirkiest, and downright awesome things you can do with your ham radio license. These aren't your grandpa's QSOs (though those are fun too)!

#### Ham Radio Mesh Networks

Imagine creating your own mini-internet using radio waves. That's what mesh networking is all about. Hams are setting up networks of nodes that can pass data between them, creating a robust, decentralized communication system. It's a wide area wireless network that doesn't go down when your ISP does!

#### APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System)

Think of APRS as social media for your radio! It lets you transmit your position, weather data, and short messages over ham radio. Imagine a real-time map showing where hams are operating, complete with status updates and local information. You can set up a home station to act as a digital signpost, have your position tracked as you drive around, or even watch the path of high-altitude balloons. It's especially useful during public service events or emergencies, allowing coordinators to see where their operators are at a glance.

#### SOTA (Summits On The Air) and POTA (Parks On The Air)

How about combining radio with the great outdoors? These activities challenge you to make contacts from mountaintops or state/national parks. It's a perfect blend of hiking and radio. Nothing beats the thrill of making a contact from a remote peak using a radio and antenna you carried up yourself!

#### Software-Defined Radio (SDR)

For the tech-savvy hams, SDR turns your computer into a powerful radio receiver (and sometimes transmitter). With SDR, you can decode digital signals, track aircraft, listen to satellites, and even receive images from weather satellites. It's like having a super-radio that can do almost anything!

#### EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) Communications

Love space? Try EME, also known as moonbounce. Yes, you can literally bounce radio signals off the moon to communicate with other hams. It's challenging and requires some serious equipment, but how cool is it to use the moon as a giant radio reflector?

#### DIY Projects

For the builders and tinkerers, there's a whole world of DIY projects. From constructing your own antennas to building QRP (low power) transceivers, the possibilities are endless. It's like adult LEGO, but with the satisfaction of making contacts on gear you built yourself!

#### Digital Modes

While not exactly new, modes like FT8 are revolutionizing how we make contacts. Using these modes, you can communicate around the world with very low power and compromised antennas. It's like having a superpower that lets you whisper across continents!

#### Fox Hunting and Direction Finding

Ever fancy yourself as a radio detective? Then you'll love fox hunting! In ham radio, a "fox" is a hidden transmitter, and your job is to find it using your radio skills and some clever equipment. It's like a high-tech game of hide-and-seek. Here's how it works:

1. Someone sets up a low-power transmitter (the "fox") in a secret location.
2. Hunters use directional antennas and radio receivers to track down the signal.
3. The first person or team to find the transmitter wins!

Fox hunting helps you develop valuable skills like understanding radio wave propagation, emergency communications practice, and hands-on experience with directional antennas. To get started, you just need a handheld radio, a simple directional antenna (like a Yagi), and an attenuator. Many clubs organize regular fox hunts, making it a great way to meet other hams and have some outdoor radio fun.

While this is often done as a fun activity, it's also a useful skill to help locate sources of noise or jamming! Fun story – there was a time when for a few weeks a bunch of the wireless garage doors in the neighborhood weren't working. After some discussions, we noticed there was a signal on the frequencies they used which seemed to be interfering, so several of us got out our direction finding gear to track it down.

You can imagine my chagrin when we tracked the signal to a repeater in my garage! It turned out there was a loose connection which was allowing some signals from the repeater and from a broadcast station to mix together and produce the problematic signal.

#### Contesting

Ever felt the thrill of a race? Well, ham radio has its own version of high-speed competition - Contesting! It's like a radio marathon where the goal is to make as many contacts as possible in a set time period. Here's the scoop:

1. What's a contest? It's an event where hams compete to make the most contacts, often with specific goals like working different countries, states, or grid squares. Some last a few hours, others a full weekend. It's like a global radio party!

2. How does it work? You'll exchange brief info with each station you contact - usually a signal report and some other data like your location or a serial number. Quick and efficient is the name of the game here.

3. What's good contest etiquette? Keep it short and sweet. Send only the minimum info needed for a valid contact. It's not the time for a lengthy chat - save that for after the contest!

4. Why contest? It's a great way to improve your operating skills, test your station's performance, and maybe snag some rare locations for awards. Plus, the adrenaline rush is real!

5. Get on the air! Many contests have sections for newcomers or low-power stations. It's a perfect way to dip your toes into the contesting waters.

6. After the contest: Submit your log to the contest organizers. You might just win an award or certificate!

Contesting is not just about winning, though. It's a fantastic way to practice your skills, learn to operate efficiently, and be part of a global ham radio event. Whether you're in it to win it or just to have fun, there's a contest out there for you. So why not give it a shot? You might just discover your new favorite ham radio activity!

##### Grid locators

Now, let's talk about a cool tool used in many contests: grid locators. These are like GPS coordinates for hams, but way easier to say over the radio. A grid locator is a combination of letters and numbers that represents your location on Earth. For example, 'FM18' covers the Washington D.C. area. In contests, you might exchange grid squares instead of states or countries. It's like a global game of battleship! But grid locators aren't just for contests. They're super useful for satellite operations, VHF/UHF work, and even general ragchewing when you want to share your location. So next time someone asks for your grid square, you'll know exactly what they mean!

Here are some examples:

| Landmark | Address | City, State, ZIP | Grid Locator |
|----------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Statue of Liberty | Liberty Island | New York, NY 10004 | FN20xq |
| Golden Gate Bridge | Golden Gate Bridge | San Francisco, CA 94129 | CM87ts |
| White House | 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW | Washington, D.C. 20500 | FM18lv |
| Space Needle | 400 Broad St | Seattle, WA 98109 | CN87to |
| Graceland | 3764 Elvis Presley Blvd | Memphis, TN 38116 | EM45xb |

These examples show how grid locators can pinpoint locations across the United States. Notice how the first two characters (like FM, CM, etc.) give a rough idea of the region, while the following characters narrow down the specific location. This system allows hams to quickly communicate their approximate location without needing to exchange detailed coordinates.

#### So much more!

Remember, these are just a few examples of the amazing things you can do with ham radio. The hobby is constantly evolving, with hams finding new and innovative ways to use radio technology. Whether you're into high-tech experimentation or good old-fashioned conversation, there's always something new to try.

So don't be afraid to explore, experiment, and push the boundaries of what's possible with your license. Who knows? You might just pioneer the next big thing in ham radio. Now get out there and make some radio magic happen!
