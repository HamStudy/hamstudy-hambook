### Section 8.2: Authorized Frequencies

Alright, new Technicians, it's time to talk about your playground - the frequencies you're allowed to use! As a Technician class operator, you have a wide range of frequencies at your disposal, from HF all the way up to microwaves. Let's break it down:

1. HF (High Frequency) Privileges:
   - 80 meters: CW only on 3.525 - 3.600 MHz
   - 40 meters: CW only on 7.025 - 7.125 MHz
   - 15 meters: CW only on 21.025 - 21.200 MHz
   - 10 meters: 
     - CW, RTTY, and Data: 28.000 - 28.300MHz
     - Phone (SSB) and CW: 28.300 - 28.500 MHz

2. VHF (Very High Frequency):
   - 6 meters: 50 - 54 MHz
   - 2 meters: 144 - 148 MHz
   - 1.25 meters
     - 219 - 220 MHz - †Fixed digital message formatting only
     - 222 - 225 MHz

3. UHF (Ultra High Frequency):
   - 70 centimeters: 420 - 450 MHz

4. Microwave bands: 
   - Various bands above 902 MHz

Remember that "CW", short for "Carrier Wave", refers to morse code! "Phone" means anything with voice, and data is anything digital.

> † A special note about the 1.25 meter band (220-225 MHz): This band has a unique allocation. The segment from 219-220 MHz is reserved exclusively for fixed digital message forwarding systems. There is then a gap from 220-222 MHz that we aren't allowed to use (there was a time in the past when we could). The rest of the band, from 222-225 MHz, is available for general use.

Of course, these are just your transmitting privileges. You can listen on any frequency!

Identifying Wavelength:
To quickly estimate the wavelength of a frequency, use this simple formula:
Wavelength (in meters) = 300 / Frequency (in MHz)

For example:
- 146.52 MHz (2 meters): $\frac{300}{146.52} \approx 2.05$ meters

- 28 MHz (10 meters): $\frac{300}{28} \approx 10.7$ meters

- 52.525 MHz (6 meters): $\frac{300}{52.525} \approx 5.7$ meters

This works because wavelength refers to how "long" a single cycle of the "wave" is – in other words, the distance that the signal travels during one cycle. Since radio waves travel at approximately 300,000,000 meters per second, if your signal is 146MHz it has 146,000,000 cycles every second. That means in the time it takes it to oscillate 146 million times it travels 300 million meters, so the length of each cycle is 300 million divided by 146 million, as shown above -- and the length of the wave (or wavelength) is 2.05 meters.

This formula is why we call the 146 MHz band "2 meters" and the 28 MHz band "10 meters". It's a handy way to convert between frequency and wavelength quickly in your head or with a simple calculator!

For the exam, focus on the VHF/UHF bands and 10 meters, as these are where you'll likely spend most of your time as a new Technician. Don't stress too much about memorizing exact frequency limits for every single band - knowing the general ranges and where you have voice privileges is most important. It may take a few times going through the relevant questions in Study Mode, but you'll get to where you recognize the answers well enough to pass the exam -- and afterwards you can just print out a chart to help you remember!

Happy frequency hopping, and may your signals always find their mark!
