### Section 8.2: Authorized Frequencies

Welcome to your radio playground, new Technicians! Let's explore the frequencies you're allowed to use. As a Technician class operator, you've got a wide range of frequencies at your disposal, from HF all the way up to microwaves. Let's break it down:

#### HF (High Frequency) Privileges

1. 80 meters: CW only on 3.525 - 3.600 MHz
2. 40 meters: CW only on 7.025 - 7.125 MHz
3. 15 meters: CW only on 21.025 - 21.200 MHz
4. 10 meters: 
   - CW, RTTY, and Data: 28.000 - 28.300 MHz
   - Phone (SSB) and CW: 28.300 - 28.500 MHz

#### VHF (Very High Frequency)

1. 6 meters: 50 - 54 MHz
   - 50.0 - 50.1MHz: CW only
   - 50.1 - 54: All modes including voice
2. 2 meters: 144 - 148 MHz
   - 144.0 - 144.1 MHz: CW only
   - 144.1 - 148 MHz: All modes including voice
3. 1.25 meters:
   - 219 - 220 MHz: Fixed digital message forwarding only
   - 222 - 225 MHz: All modes including voice

#### UHF (Ultra High Frequency)

1. 70 centimeters: 420 - 450 MHz

#### Microwave Bands

Various bands above 902 MHz

Remember, "CW" (short for "Continuous Wave") refers to Morse code, "Phone" means voice transmissions, and "Data" covers digital modes.

#### Special Note on the 1.25 Meter Band

The 1.25 meter band (220-225 MHz) has a unique allocation. The segment from 219-220 MHz is reserved exclusively for fixed digital message forwarding systems. There's then a gap from 220-222 MHz that we aren't allowed to use (there was a time in the past when we could). The rest of the band, from 222-225 MHz, is available for general use. It's like a highway with a special lane for digital traffic and a wider lane for everything else!

#### Power Limits for Technician Class Operators

Now that we've covered where you can transmit, let's talk about how much power you can use. As a Technician, you've got some hefty power limits to work with:

1. HF Bands: On the HF bands where you have privileges (remember those 80, 40, 15, and 10 meter segments we talked about?), you're allowed a maximum peak envelope power (PEP) output of 200 watts. If that doesn't seem like a lot consider that most typical HF radios have a maximum output power of 100 watts *or less*.

2. VHF and Above: For frequencies at 50 MHz and above (that's your 6 meter, 2 meter, 70 cm bands, and beyond), you've got even more power at your disposal. The general limit is 1500 watts PEP output. To say that this is excessive for most purposes would be a tiny bit of an understatement – the typical VHF/UHF radio has a max power output of 50 watts and that's usually plenty.

Now, before you get too excited about cranking up the power, remember a few things:

- Just because you can use that much power doesn't mean you always should. Good operators use the minimum power necessary to make the contact. It's like using an "indoor voice" - you don't shout when a normal conversation will do.

- Some modes or specific segments might have lower power limits. Always check the current band plan and regulations.

- With great power comes great responsibility. Higher power means more potential for interference with neighbors' electronics and more safety considerations in your shack.

- Your antenna system plays a huge role in how effective your signal is. A good antenna with lower power often outperforms a poor antenna with high power. Additionally, using too much power can damage most antennas! Even the coax you use may not hold up to 1500 watts for long before the heat generated from power loss becomes a problem.
  
  Just to make the point, let's look at an example: Say you have a 100 foot run of RG-58 and you are running 1500 watts at 146MHz. Using a handy online calculator we can calculate the total loss at around ***4.839 dB***! If you put 1500 watts in you will only get 492.286 watts out of the antenna which means your coax will be radiating over 1000 watts of power as heat along that 100 feet of cable! That's as much as most space heaters – and coax isn't designed to handle that kind of heat for long.

Remember, as a Technician, you're learning the ropes of ham radio. Start with lower power, learn good operating practices, and work your way up as you gain experience. It's not about how much power you can pump out - it's about how effectively you can communicate!

#### Listening Privileges

While these are your transmitting privileges, you can listen on any frequency. It's like having an all-access pass to the radio concert, but you can only sing along on certain stages!

#### Calculating Wavelength

Want to sound like a radio wizard? Here's a quick trick to estimate wavelength:

Wavelength (in meters) = 300 / Frequency (in MHz)

For example:
- 146.52 MHz (2 meters): 300 / 146.52 ≈ 2.05 meters
- 28 MHz (10 meters): 300 / 28 ≈ 10.7 meters
- 52.525 MHz (6 meters): 300 / 52.525 ≈ 5.7 meters

This works because wavelength is how far a radio wave travels during one complete cycle. Since radio waves zip along at about 300,000,000 meters per second, this formula gives us a quick approximation.

#### Operating Near Band Edges

Here's a pro tip that might save you from an FCC warning: Be careful about operating right at the edge of a band or sub-band. It's like walking a tightrope over a pool of regulatory sharks - one small misstep and you could find yourself in dangerous waters. Here's why you should give yourself a little buffer:

1. Frequency Accuracy: Your radio's frequency display might not be 100% accurate. Even a small error could put you out of bounds.

2. Modulation Sidebands: When you transmit, your signal takes up more space than just the frequency you're tuned to. The sidebands of your transmission could spill over into unauthorized frequencies if you're too close to the edge.

3. Frequency Drift: Some radios, especially if they're not warmed up, might drift slightly in frequency as you operate.

For these reasons, it's good practice to stay a little bit inside the band edges when you transmit. Think of it as giving yourself a safety margin. Most experienced hams try to stay at least a few kHz inside the band, just to be on the safe side.

It's always better to err on the side of caution and keep your signals well within the authorized limits. That way, you can focus on enjoying your contacts without worrying about accidentally straying out of bounds!

#### Exam Tips

For the exam, focus on the VHF/UHF bands and 10 meters - that's where you'll spend most of your time as a new Technician. Don't stress about memorizing exact frequency limits for every band. Knowing the general ranges and where you have voice privileges is most important. 

Remember, it might take a few practice runs in Study Mode, but you'll soon recognize the answers well enough to ace the exam. And once you're licensed, you can always keep a frequency chart handy in your shack!

Happy frequency hopping, and may your signals always find their mark!
