# About Amateur Radio

Amateur radio, often called "ham radio," is a fascinating hobby and public service that allows people to communicate across the globe without the need for cell phones or the internet. It's a vibrant community of enthusiasts who use radio technology to connect with others, experiment with electronics, and provide vital communication during emergencies.

## A World of Possibilities

Imagine being able to chat with an astronaut aboard the International Space Station, or exchange messages with someone in a remote village in Africa. With amateur radio, these scenarios aren't just possibleâ€”they happen regularly! Ham radio operators, or "hams," use a variety of technologies to communicate, from traditional voice transmissions to cutting-edge digital modes that can send text and images across continents with very low power.

## More Than Just a Hobby

While many enjoy amateur radio as a pastime, it also serves a crucial role in emergency communications. When disaster strikes and normal communication infrastructure fails, ham radio operators often become the vital link that helps coordinate rescue efforts and relay important information.

For example, during Hurricane Maria in 2017, amateur radio operators in Puerto Rico provided critical communication support when much of the island's infrastructure was destroyed. They relayed emergency messages, helped coordinate relief efforts, and even assisted in reuniting families who had lost contact during the disaster.

## A Community of Innovators

Ham radio has a rich history of technological innovation. Many of the advancements we take for granted in modern communications were first developed or refined by amateur radio enthusiasts. From the early days of radio to the cutting edge of digital communications, hams have been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of what's possible with wireless technology.

In 2014, a group of amateur radio operators made headlines when they repurposed an old NASA satellite for amateur use. The ISEE-3 satellite, launched in 1978 and long since abandoned by NASA, was brought back to life through the efforts of these innovative hams, showcasing the ingenuity and technical skill present in the amateur radio community.

## A Hobby for Everyone

Whether you're interested in the technical aspects of radio, enjoy the thrill of making long-distance contacts, or want to be prepared to help your community in times of need, amateur radio has something to offer. It's a hobby that spans generations, with operators ranging from young students to retirees, all sharing a common passion for radio communication.

As you embark on your journey into the world of amateur radio, you'll discover a welcoming community eager to share knowledge and experiences. From local club meetings to international contests, there are countless opportunities to learn, grow, and connect with fellow enthusiasts around the world.

## The purpose of Amateur Radio

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates and enforces the rules for the Amateur Radio service in the United States and it was established with specific purposes in mind. These form the basis and purpose of our hobby and service:

1. Advancing skills in both the technical and communication aspects of radio.
2. Expanding the pool of trained operators, technicians, and electronic experts.
3. Enhancing international goodwill through global communications.
4. Providing a voluntary noncommercial communication service to the public, especially in times of emergency.
5. Contributing to the advancement of the radio art.

These purposes highlight the multifaceted nature of amateur radio - it's not just a hobby, but a service with important technical, social, and public safety roles. As you progress in amateur radio, you'll find opportunities to fulfill each of these purposes, whether you're experimenting with new technologies, making friends across the globe, or helping your community during emergencies.
