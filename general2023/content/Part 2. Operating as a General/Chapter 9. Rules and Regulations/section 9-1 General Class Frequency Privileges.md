### Section 9.1: General Class Frequency Privileges

The moment you passed your General exam, the HF world exploded open. Where before you could only taste HF through tiny slivers of 10, 15, and 40 meters, now you command vast swaths of spectrum from 160 meters all the way through 10 meters. 

But with great power comes... frequency charts. Lots of frequency charts.

Don't worry—you won't need to memorize every kilohertz boundary. What you need is a solid understanding of where you can operate and, just as importantly, where you can't. Because accidentally transmitting in the Extra-only portion of 20 meters during a DX pileup? That's a mistake you only make once.

#### HF Band Access

Your General license opens massive portions of the HF spectrum, but it's not a free-for-all. Four popular bands still hold back their choicest real estate for Extra class operators:

> **Key Information:** *On HF and/or MF bands, General class licensees cannot transmit in portions of the 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter bands.* {{< link id="G1A01" >}}

![Chart showing restricted band segments for General class operators](../images/restricted-band-segments.svg)

Think of it like real estate: Extra class operators get the beachfront property at the bottom edge of these bands where the DX hangs out and the CW contests rage. As a General, you get everything else—which is still about 83% of all HF spectrum. Not a bad deal.

#### Mode Restrictions

Not every band welcomes every mode. The 30-meter band, in particular, plays by different rules:

> **Key Information:** *Phone operation is prohibited on the 30 meter band.* {{< link id="G1A02" >}}

Why the restriction? The 30-meter band (10.1-10.15 MHz) is only 50 kHz wide—barely room to swing a cat, let alone accommodate phone signals. Plus, we share it as secondary users with fixed services worldwide. CW and data modes? Fine. Your dulcet voice? Save it for another band.

The same logic applies to bandwidth-hungry image modes:

> **Key Information:** *Image transmission is prohibited on the 30 meter band.* {{< link id="G1A03" >}}

SSTV and fax gobble bandwidth like teenagers at a buffet. On the narrow 30-meter band, that's a recipe for interference. Want to send pictures? Use literally any other HF band where you have privileges.

#### Channel-Based Operation

Forget everything you know about tuning across a band. The 60-meter band throws out the amateur radio playbook:

> **Key Information:** *The 60 meter band is restricted to communication on specific channels, rather than frequency ranges.* {{< link id="G1A04" >}}

![Chart showing the five channels on 60 meters](../images/60m-channels.svg)

Instead of a continuous slice of spectrum, 60 meters gives you exactly five channels—period. It's like CB radio met amateur radio and had a very regulated baby:

- Channel 1: 5332.0 kHz (dial: 5330.5 kHz)
- Channel 2: 5348.0 kHz (dial: 5346.5 kHz)
- Channel 3: 5358.5 kHz (dial: 5357.0 kHz)
- Channel 4: 5373.0 kHz (dial: 5371.5 kHz)
- Channel 5: 5405.0 kHz (dial: 5403.5 kHz)

Notice the dial frequency is 1.5 kHz below the channel frequency? That's because you must use USB, and the suppressed carrier sits 1.5 kHz below your assigned channel center. Get this wrong and you're off frequency—not a good look when you only have five spots to choose from.

#### Specific Band Restrictions

Let's get specific about where you can't go. On 40 meters, there's a 50 kHz chunk that's off-limits:

> **Key Information:** *General class licensees are prohibited from operating as control operators from 7.125 MHz to 7.175 MHz.* {{< link id="G1A05" >}}

This Extra-only segment sits right in prime 40-meter phone territory. During evening hours when 40 meters comes alive with regional nets and ragchews, this restriction stings a bit. Consider it motivation for that Extra upgrade.

But here's some good news—on 10 meters, CW operators get the royal treatment:

> **Key Information:** *General class control operators may transmit CW emissions on the entire 10-meter band.* {{< link id="G1A07" >}}

From 28.000 to 29.700 MHz, if you're sending CW, you're golden. Phone privileges don't start until 28.300 MHz, but your key or keyer works everywhere. When 10 meters opens during solar peaks, this gives you maximum flexibility for working DX.

#### Understanding Extra Class Exclusive Segments

Four bands reserve their bottom portions for Extra class operators. Memorize this list—it'll save you embarrassment:

> **Key Information:** *HF bands with segments exclusively allocated to Amateur Extra licensees are 80 meters, 40 meters, 20 meters, and 15 meters.* {{< link id="G1A08" >}}

![Chart showing Extra class exclusive segments on HF bands](../images/extra-exclusive-segments.svg)

Why these four? They're the contest bands, the DX bands, the "where the action is" bands. Extra privileges on 80, 40, 20, and 15 meters mean access to the CW DX window, prime contest territory, and those sweet spots where the rare DX stations hang out. 

The good news? You still get the vast majority of each band. The better news? Bands like 160, 60, 30, 17, 12, and 10 meters don't have Extra-only segments at all.

#### Identifying General Class Segments

Quick quiz: Someone asks if you can operate on 21.300 MHz. Can you?

> **Key Information:** *21.300 MHz is within the General class portion of the 15-meter band.* {{< link id="G1A09" >}}

Yes! Here's how to figure it out: The 15-meter band runs from 21.000 to 21.450 MHz. General class operators get:
- CW privileges: 21.025-21.200 MHz
- Phone privileges: 21.275-21.450 MHz

Since 21.300 MHz sits comfortably in the phone segment, fire up that microphone. This kind of quick mental math becomes second nature after a few months on HF.

#### Repeater Operation on 10 Meters

10 meters holds a surprise—it's the only HF band with a repeater segment:

> **Key Information:** *The portion of the 10-meter band available for repeater use is above 29.5 MHz.* {{< link id="G1A10" >}}

From 29.5 to 29.7 MHz, you'll find FM repeaters that spring to life during band openings. Picture this: You're mobile with a simple vertical antenna, and suddenly you're working stations 1,500 miles away through a repeater—with 10 watts. When propagation cooperates, 10-meter repeaters deliver magic.

Most use a 100 kHz negative offset (listen on 29.600, transmit on 29.500), just like 2-meter repeaters but with ionospheric enhancement.

#### Understanding Voice Segment Allocation

Here's a pattern that makes band plans easier to remember:

> **Key Information:** *When General class licensees are not permitted to use the entire voice portion of a band, they can use the upper frequency portion.* {{< link id="G1A11" >}}

![Diagram showing General class access to upper portions of voice segments](../images/general-voice-privileges.svg)

Think of it as Extras getting the basement, Generals getting everything else. On 75 meters phone? Extras start at 3.600 MHz, you start at 3.800 MHz. On 20 meters? They begin at 14.150 MHz, you begin at 14.225 MHz. Always the upper portion.

This arrangement actually works well—it keeps the bands from becoming a confusing patchwork of privileges while still rewarding license advancement.

#### Power Limits

Not all bands are created equal when it comes to power limits. The 30-meter band keeps you on a shorter leash:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum transmitter power an amateur station may use on 10.140 MHz is 200 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C01" >}}

Why only 200 watts on 30 meters? We're secondary users on a narrow band. Running a kilowatt would be like bringing a flamethrower to light birthday candles—excessive and likely to cause problems.

Most other HF bands let you run full legal power:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum transmitter power an amateur station may use on the 12-meter band is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C02" >}}

> **Key Information:** *The limit for transmitter power on the 28 MHz band for a General Class control operator is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C05" >}}

> **Key Information:** *The limit for transmitter power on the 1.8 MHz band is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C06" >}}

But here's the thing: Just because you can run 1500 watts doesn't mean you should. The rule says use the minimum power necessary to carry out your communications. Running a kilowatt to talk to the next state? That's like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture.

How does the FCC measure power limits?

> **Key Information:** *PEP output from the transmitter is the measurement specified by FCC rules that regulate maximum power.* {{< link id="G1C11" >}}

PEP (Peak Envelope Power) measures average power during one RF cycle at the voice peak. It's the fairest way to compare different modes—CW, SSB, and FM all get measured by the same standard.

#### Special Requirements for 60 Meters

60 meters isn't just channelized—it comes with a whole rulebook of special requirements. First, watch your bandwidth:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum bandwidth permitted by FCC rules for amateur radio stations transmitting on USB frequencies in the 60-meter band is 2.8 kHz.* {{< link id="G1C03" >}}

![Diagram showing 2.8 kHz maximum bandwidth on 60 meters](../images/60m-bandwidth.svg)

That 2.8 kHz limit means no hi-fi audio experiments here. Keep your transmit bandwidth narrow—the primary users we share with don't appreciate sprawling signals.

Using a beam or other gain antenna? Get your pencil ready:

> **Key Information:** *When operating in the 60-meter band, if you are using an antenna other than a dipole, you must keep a record of the gain of your antenna.* {{< link id="G1C04" >}}

Why the paperwork? Because power limits on 60 meters work differently:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum power limit on the 60-meter band is ERP of 100 watts PEP with respect to a dipole.* {{< link id="G1C09" >}}

Notice that's ERP (Effective Radiated Power), not transmitter output. Running 100 watts into a 3 dB gain antenna? You're over the limit—cut power to 50 watts. The antenna gain record keeping ensures you can prove compliance if anyone asks.

60 meters: Great propagation, lots of rules. Welcome to secondary allocations.

#### Frequency Privileges Reference Chart

Print this out. Laminate it. Tape it to your radio:

| Band | Frequency Range | CW Privileges | Phone/Image Privileges | Max Power |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 160m | 1.8-2.0 MHz     | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 80m  | 3.5-4.0 MHz     | 3.525-4.0 MHz | 3.8-4.0 MHz            | 1500W PEP |
| 60m  | Five channels   | Not permitted | USB only               | 100W ERP  |
| 40m  | 7.0-7.3 MHz     | 7.025-7.3 MHz | 7.175-7.3 MHz          | 1500W PEP |
| 30m  | 10.1-10.15 MHz  | Entire band   | Not permitted          | 200W PEP  |
| 20m  | 14.0-14.35 MHz  | 14.025-14.35 MHz | 14.225-14.35 MHz    | 1500W PEP |
| 17m  | 18.068-18.168 MHz | Entire band | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 15m  | 21.0-21.45 MHz  | 21.025-21.45 MHz | 21.275-21.45 MHz    | 1500W PEP |
| 12m  | 24.89-24.99 MHz | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 10m  | 28.0-29.7 MHz   | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |

Notice the pattern? Extra-only segments on 80, 40, 20, and 15. Special rules for 60 and 30. Full run of the place on 160, 17, 12, and 10. Once you see the pattern, it sticks.

#### Making the Most of Your New Privileges

You've got the ticket—now what? With 83% of all amateur HF spectrum at your command, the hardest part is choosing where to start.

**Your First Week on HF:**
Start on 20 meters around 14.250 MHz. It's the most reliable DX band, active from sunrise to well after sunset. Listen before transmitting. Get a feel for the rhythm. When you hear "CQ DX," that's someone hunting for long-distance contacts. When ready, answer one. Your first contact with Europe or Japan will hook you for life.

**The WARC Bands—Your Secret Weapon:**
30, 17, and 12 meters don't allow contests. Ever. Result? Actual conversations instead of "59, thanks, QRZ?" When the contest bands sound like warfare, slide over to 17 meters for civilized QSOs.

**Time Your Band Selection:**
- Sunrise: Check 20 and 17 meters toward the east
- Midday: 15 and 12 meters if solar flux is up
- Late afternoon: 20 meters to the west, 17 worldwide
- Evening: 40 meters for regional, 80 for closer contacts
- Late night: 160 and 80 meters for night owls

**Tools of the Trade:**
- DX clusters show you who's on and where
- Propagation prediction sites tell you what should work
- Reverse beacon network shows where your signal is heard
- Your logbook tracks what actually worked

**The Golden Rule:**
Listen, listen, listen. Every band has its culture. 75 meters has nets and roundtables. 20 meters lives for DX. 40 meters does a bit of everything. Learn the rhythms before jumping in.

Your General ticket isn't just a license—it's a passport to global communication. In the next section, we'll explore what happens when amateur radio shares spectrum with other services, and why being "secondary" doesn't mean second-class.
