### Section 9.1: General Class Frequency Privileges

One of the most exciting aspects of upgrading to General class is the dramatic expansion of your operating privileges. While Technician class licenses provide limited HF access, your General class license unlocks substantial portions of all amateur bands, opening the door to reliable regional, national, and international communications. Let's explore what you can do with your new privileges.

#### HF Band Access

Your General license gives you significant privileges across all HF bands, though certain segments remain reserved for higher license classes:

> **Key Information:** *On HF and/or MF bands, General class licensees cannot transmit in portions of the 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter bands.* {{< link id="G1A01" >}}

<img src="../images/restricted-band-segments.svg" alt="Chart showing restricted band segments for General class operators" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

These restricted segments are typically at the lower end of each band and are reserved for Amateur Extra class licensees. This band plan allows for progressive privileges as operators advance in license class while still providing General class operators with substantial access to all amateur bands.

#### Mode Restrictions

While you now have access to all amateur modes, some bands have mode-specific limitations:

> **Key Information:** *Phone operation is prohibited on the 30 meter band.* {{< link id="G1A02" >}}

The 30-meter band (10.1-10.15 MHz) is a relatively narrow band with a primary allocation to the fixed service internationally, with amateur radio as secondary. To minimize potential interference, phone operation is not permitted on this bandâ€”only CW and data modes are allowed.

Similarly, there are restrictions on image transmissions:

> **Key Information:** *Image transmission is prohibited on the 30 meter band.* {{< link id="G1A03" >}}

Image modes like SSTV (Slow Scan Television) and facsimile use significant bandwidth, which could cause problems on the narrow 30-meter band. These modes are prohibited on 30 meters but are permitted on most other HF bands where General class operators have privileges.

#### Channel-Based Operation

Most amateur bands allow operation across a continuous frequency range, but one band operates differently:

> **Key Information:** *The 60 meter band is restricted to communication on specific channels, rather than frequency ranges.* {{< link id="G1A04" >}}

<img src="../images/60m-channels.svg" alt="Chart showing the five channels on 60 meters" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

Unlike other HF bands, the 60-meter band (5 MHz) is allocated to amateur radio on a secondary basis with specific restrictions. Rather than a continuous frequency range, operators must use five specific channels:
- Channel 1: 5332.0 kHz (5330.5 kHz dial frequency)
- Channel 2: 5348.0 kHz (5346.5 kHz dial frequency)
- Channel 3: 5358.5 kHz (5357.0 kHz dial frequency)
- Channel 4: 5373.0 kHz (5371.5 kHz dial frequency)
- Channel 5: 5405.0 kHz (5403.5 kHz dial frequency)

When operating on 60 meters, you must use USB voice, with your transmitter dial set 1.5 kHz below the channel frequency to account for the suppressed carrier.

#### Specific Band Restrictions

Certain bands have specific frequency segments where General class operators must not transmit:

> **Key Information:** *General class licensees are prohibited from operating as control operators from 7.125 MHz to 7.175 MHz.* {{< link id="G1A05" >}}

This portion of the 40-meter band is reserved for Amateur Extra class licensees. Similar restrictions exist on other bands.

However, you have full CW privileges on some bands:

> **Key Information:** *General class control operators may transmit CW emissions on the entire 10-meter band.* {{< link id="G1A07" >}}

While phone privileges may be restricted to certain portions of some bands, CW (Morse code) operation is often permitted across broader frequency ranges.

#### Understanding Extra Class Exclusive Segments

It's important to know which portions of the bands are reserved for Extra class licensees:

> **Key Information:** *HF bands with segments exclusively allocated to Amateur Extra licensees are 80 meters, 40 meters, 20 meters, and 15 meters.* {{< link id="G1A08" >}}

<img src="../images/extra-exclusive-segments.svg" alt="Chart showing Extra class exclusive segments on HF bands" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

These exclusive segments are typically at the lower end of each band, where CW and digital operations are concentrated. As a General class operator, you still have access to the majority of these bands, but must avoid the Extra-only portions.

#### Identifying General Class Segments

When looking at band plans, you need to identify which segments you can use:

> **Key Information:** *21.300 MHz is within the General class portion of the 15-meter band.* {{< link id="G1A09" >}}

The 15-meter band extends from 21.000 to 21.450 MHz. As a General class operator, you can use:
- 21.025-21.200 MHz for CW
- 21.275-21.450 MHz for phone and image

The frequency 21.300 MHz falls within your General class phone privileges on this band.

#### Repeater Operation on 10 Meters

Repeater operation isn't just for VHF and UHF bands:

> **Key Information:** *The portion of the 10-meter band available for repeater use is above 29.5 MHz.* {{< link id="G1A10" >}}

The 10-meter band (28.0-29.7 MHz) includes provisions for repeater operation, but only in the upper portion of the band above 29.5 MHz. These repeaters typically use a 100 kHz offset between input and output frequencies.

#### Understanding Voice Segment Allocation

When General class operators don't have access to the entire voice portion of a band, there's a pattern to which portions they can use:

> **Key Information:** *When General class licensees are not permitted to use the entire voice portion of a band, they can use the upper frequency portion.* {{< link id="G1A11" >}}

<img src="../images/general-voice-privileges.svg" alt="Diagram showing General class access to upper portions of voice segments" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

This arrangement allows both General and Extra class operators to share the bands while giving Extra class operators exclusive access to smaller premium segments.

#### Power Limits

Different bands have different maximum power limits:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum transmitter power an amateur station may use on 10.140 MHz is 200 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C01" >}}

The 30-meter band (where 10.140 MHz is located) has a reduced power limit of 200 watts PEP (Peak Envelope Power) due to its secondary status and narrow bandwidth.

Most other HF bands allow higher power:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum transmitter power an amateur station may use on the 12-meter band is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C02" >}}

This 1500-watt limit applies to most amateur bands, including the 28 MHz band:

> **Key Information:** *The limit for transmitter power on the 28 MHz band for a General Class control operator is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C05" >}}

This same 1500-watt limit applies to the 1.8 MHz band:

> **Key Information:** *The limit for transmitter power on the 1.8 MHz band is 1500 watts PEP output.* {{< link id="G1C06" >}}

Remember that the FCC requires all amateur stations to use the minimum power necessary to maintain communications. The 1500-watt limit is the maximum allowed, not a recommendation for routine operation.

When measuring power, the FCC is specific about which measurement to use:

> **Key Information:** *PEP output from the transmitter is the measurement specified by FCC rules that regulate maximum power.* {{< link id="G1C11" >}}

Peak Envelope Power (PEP) is the average power during one RF cycle at the peak of the modulation envelope. This measurement provides a consistent way to specify power limits across different modes.

#### Special Requirements for 60 Meters

The 60-meter band has additional unique requirements beyond being channelized:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum bandwidth permitted by FCC rules for amateur radio stations transmitting on USB frequencies in the 60-meter band is 2.8 kHz.* {{< link id="G1C03" >}}

<img src="../images/60m-bandwidth.svg" alt="Diagram showing 2.8 kHz maximum bandwidth on 60 meters" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

This bandwidth limitation helps ensure amateur operations don't interfere with primary users of the band. Additionally:

> **Key Information:** *When operating in the 60-meter band, if you are using an antenna other than a dipole, you must keep a record of the gain of your antenna.* {{< link id="G1C04" >}}

This record-keeping requirement helps ensure compliance with effective radiated power (ERP) limits on this band.

60 meters also has a specific power limit:

> **Key Information:** *The maximum power limit on the 60-meter band is ERP of 100 watts PEP with respect to a dipole.* {{< link id="G1C09" >}}

Note that this limit is specified as Effective Radiated Power (ERP) relative to a dipole, not just transmitter output power. If you use an antenna with gain, you must reduce your transmitter power to stay within the 100-watt ERP limit.

#### Frequency Privileges Reference Chart

Here's a simplified reference chart of General class HF privileges by band:

| Band | Frequency Range | CW Privileges | Phone/Image Privileges | Max Power |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 160m | 1.8-2.0 MHz     | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 80m  | 3.5-4.0 MHz     | 3.525-4.0 MHz | 3.8-4.0 MHz            | 1500W PEP |
| 60m  | Five channels   | Not permitted | USB only               | 100W ERP  |
| 40m  | 7.0-7.3 MHz     | 7.025-7.3 MHz | 7.175-7.3 MHz          | 1500W PEP |
| 30m  | 10.1-10.15 MHz  | Entire band   | Not permitted          | 200W PEP  |
| 20m  | 14.0-14.35 MHz  | 14.025-14.35 MHz | 14.225-14.35 MHz    | 1500W PEP |
| 17m  | 18.068-18.168 MHz | Entire band | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 15m  | 21.0-21.45 MHz  | 21.025-21.45 MHz | 21.275-21.45 MHz    | 1500W PEP |
| 12m  | 24.89-24.99 MHz | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |
| 10m  | 28.0-29.7 MHz   | Entire band   | Entire band            | 1500W PEP |

This chart provides a quick reference, but always consult current band plans and regulations as they may change over time.

#### Making the Most of Your New Privileges

With your General class license, you now have access to approximately 83% of all amateur HF spectrum. These new privileges open up reliable regional, national, and global communication opportunities. Here are some suggestions for exploring your expanded frequency access:

1. **Start on 20 meters**: The 20-meter band (14 MHz) offers reliable long-distance propagation throughout much of the day and across seasons. It's an excellent place to begin your HF adventures.

2. **Explore the WARC bands**: The 30, 17, and 12-meter bands (named after the World Administrative Radio Conference where they were allocated) don't allow contests and often have a more relaxed pace of operation.

3. **Try different times of day**: Lower frequency bands (160, 80, 40 meters) typically work better at night, while higher frequency bands (20, 17, 15, 12, 10 meters) generally perform better during daylight hours.

4. **Check propagation tools**: Resources like the DX Cluster, propagation forecasts, and reverse beacon networks can help you determine which bands are open to which parts of the world.

5. **Keep a band plan reference handy**: Until you've memorized your frequency privileges, keep a printed or digital reference available while operating to ensure you stay within authorized segments.

Your General class license represents a significant step up in privileges and capabilities. As you explore these new frequency allocations, you'll discover the fascinating world of HF propagation and the joy of communicating over great distances with modest equipment.
