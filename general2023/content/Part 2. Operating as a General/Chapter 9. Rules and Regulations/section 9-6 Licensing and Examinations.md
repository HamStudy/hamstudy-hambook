### Section 9.6: Licensing and Examinations

Now that you've earned your General class license, you're in a unique position to understand the licensing and examination process from the inside. This section will deepen your knowledge of how the amateur radio licensing system works and may even prepare you to help others enter or advance in the hobby.

#### License Credit and Renewals

If someone previously held an amateur license that has expired, they may qualify for partial credit toward a new license:

> **Key Information:** *Partial credit for the elements represented by an expired amateur radio license may be given to any person who can demonstrate that they once held an FCC-issued General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra class license that was not revoked by the FCC.* {{< link id="G1D01" >}}

<img src="../images/license-credit-process.svg" alt="Flowchart showing license credit process" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

This provision helps former licensees return to amateur radio without starting completely from scratch. The credit applies only if:
- The license was General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra class
- The license expired within the past two years OR the person can prove they once held such a license
- The license was not revoked by the FCC

For example, someone who held a General class license that expired 10 years ago might receive credit for Element 2 (Technician written exam), requiring them to pass only Element 3 (General written exam) to regain General class privileges.

#### Volunteer Examiners

As a General class operator, you now qualify to begin serving as a Volunteer Examiner (VE) for certain exam elements:

> **Key Information:** *A General class licensee who has been accredited as a Volunteer Examiner may administer Technician examinations only.* {{< link id="G1D02" >}}

<img src="../images/ve-privileges-by-class.svg" alt="Chart showing VE privileges by license class" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

The VE system is the backbone of amateur radio licensing in the US. Different license classes can administer different exam elements:
- **Technician VEs**: Cannot administer exams
- **General VEs**: Can administer Technician (Element 2) exams
- **Amateur Extra VEs**: Can administer Technician, General, and Amateur Extra exams

To serve as a VE, you must first be accredited by a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) like the ARRL VEC, W5YI VEC, or others. This process typically involves studying the relevant regulations and procedures, then completing an open-book examination.

#### Operating with a CSCE

After passing an exam but before your upgrade appears in the FCC database, you have temporary operating privileges:

> **Key Information:** *A Technician class operator who has an unexpired Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) for General class privileges may operate on any General or Technician class band segment.* {{< link id="G1D03" >}}

<img src="../images/csce-privileges.svg" alt="Diagram showing CSCE certificate and associated privileges" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

The Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) serves as temporary proof of your new privileges until the FCC processes your upgrade. While operating with CSCE-granted privileges, special identification is required:

> **Key Information:** *Until an upgrade to General class is shown in the FCC database, a Technician must identify with "AG" after their call sign when operating using General class frequency privileges.* {{< link id="G1D06" >}}

For example, someone using their new General privileges with a CSCE would identify as "W1ABC AG" to indicate they're operating with temporarily authorized General privileges.

The CSCE has a limited validity period:

> **Key Information:** *A Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) is valid for exam element credit for 365 days.* {{< link id="G1D09" >}}

This one-year window gives the FCC and the applicant ample time to complete the licensing process while still ensuring the knowledge is current.

#### VE Requirements

The VE system has specific requirements to ensure integrity and accessibility:

> **Key Information:** *At least three Volunteer Examiners of General class or higher must observe the administration of a Technician class license examination.* {{< link id="G1D04" >}}

<img src="../images/ve-session-requirements.svg" alt="Diagram showing VE session requirements" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

A minimum of three VEs must be present for any examination session. This provides adequate oversight and prevents potential improprieties.

VEs are selected and certified by Volunteer Examiner Coordinators:

> **Key Information:** *Volunteer Examiners are accredited by a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator.* {{< link id="G1D07" >}}

VECs are organizations that have entered into agreements with the FCC to coordinate the volunteer testing program. They develop procedures, maintain question pools, accredit VEs, and report examination results to the FCC.

VE service is open to qualified licensees regardless of citizenship:

> **Key Information:** *To be an accredited Volunteer Examiner, a non-US citizen must hold an FCC granted amateur radio license of General class or above.* {{< link id="G1D08" >}}

The focus is on knowledge and licensing status, not citizenship. Any properly licensed amateur who meets the requirements can serve as a VE.

There is also an age requirement for VEs:

> **Key Information:** *The minimum age that one must be to qualify as an accredited Volunteer Examiner is 18 years.* {{< link id="G1D10" >}}

This requirement ensures that VEs have the legal standing and maturity to administer what is effectively a federal examination program.

#### License Expiration and Renewal

Amateur licenses are granted for a 10-year term. If a license expires and the grace period passes:

> **Key Information:** *To obtain a new General class license after a previously held license has expired and the two-year grace period has passed, the applicant must show proof of the appropriate expired license grant and pass the current Element 2 exam.* {{< link id="G1D11" >}}

<img src="../images/license-renewal-process.svg" alt="Flowchart showing license renewal process" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

The two-year grace period after expiration allows former licensees to renew without retesting. After this period, partial credit is still available, but at least Element 2 (the Technician written exam) must be passed.

To maintain continuous amateur radio privileges:
1. Monitor your license expiration date
2. Apply for renewal within 90 days before expiration
3. If your license expires, you have a two-year grace period to renew without examination
4. After the grace period, you must take at least Element 2 to regain privileges

The FCC's Universal Licensing System (ULS) can send email reminders of upcoming license expirations if you maintain a current email address in the system.

#### Class-Specific Operation Rules

Different license classes sometimes have unique operating restrictions:

> **Key Information:** *When may a 10-meter repeater retransmit the 2-meter signal from a station that has a Technician class control operator? Only if the 10-meter repeater control operator holds at least a General class license.* {{< link id="G1E02" >}}

<img src="../images/cross-band-repeater-operation.svg" alt="Diagram showing cross-band repeater operation requirements" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

This specific rule addresses cross-band operation between VHF/UHF bands (where Technicians have full privileges) and HF bands (where General or higher class is typically required). The repeater control operator must have privileges for both bands involved in the cross-band operation.

#### The Licensing Pathway

The US amateur licensing system is designed as a progressive pathway:

1. **Technician Class**: Entry-level license with VHF/UHF and limited HF privileges
2. **General Class**: Intermediate license with significant HF privileges
3. **Amateur Extra Class**: Top-level license with all amateur privileges

Each step requires passing additional examinations that test increasingly advanced knowledge of technical theory, operating practices, and regulations.

As a General class operator, you've already mastered two-thirds of this pathway. The final step—Amateur Extra class—would grant you access to all amateur frequency privileges and the ability to administer all levels of amateur examinations.

#### The Modern VE System

The Volunteer Examiner system represents a unique partnership between the amateur community and the FCC:

1. **Development**: During the early 1980s, the FCC sought to reduce its direct involvement in amateur testing.

2. **Implementation**: The 1984 amendments to the Communications Act created the VE program, shifting examination responsibilities to volunteers from the amateur community.

3. **Expansion**: Over time, the VE program grew to handle all amateur license testing, allowing the FCC to focus on regulation rather than administration.

4. **Evolution**: The system continues to adapt, with recent changes including remote testing options developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This system benefits both the amateur community and the FCC:
- Testing is more accessible with frequent local sessions
- The amateur community has direct involvement in welcoming newcomers
- The FCC can allocate resources to other regulatory priorities
- The knowledge and expertise of experienced amateurs shapes the testing process

#### Becoming a VE

As a General class licensee, you can contribute to the future of amateur radio by becoming a Volunteer Examiner. The process typically involves:

1. **Select a VEC**: Choose which Volunteer Examiner Coordinator you wish to work with
2. **Study the Manual**: Review the VE manual for that organization
3. **Complete Accreditation**: Take an open-book examination on VE procedures
4. **Join a Team**: Connect with a local VE team to participate in examination sessions

Many amateurs find VE service rewarding—it's an opportunity to welcome newcomers to the hobby, support upgrades within the community, and continue your own education by staying current with regulations and examination content.

#### Remote Testing Options

While in-person testing remains common, many VECs now offer remote testing options:
- Online video-supervised examinations
- Remote testing with local proctors
- Hybrid approaches combining elements of both

These options have expanded access to amateur radio licensing, particularly for those in remote areas or with mobility challenges. Check with VECs for current remote testing availability and requirements.

#### Conclusion

Understanding the licensing and examination system gives you insight into the structure of amateur radio in the United States. Whether you choose to become a VE, mentor new operators, or simply maintain your own license properly, this knowledge helps you participate more fully in the amateur radio community.

Your General class license represents a significant achievement in this progressive system, opening doors to expanded operating privileges and opportunities to contribute to the future of amateur radio.
