### Section 9.6: Licensing and Examinations

Remember that nervous feeling when you sat for your General exam? The sweaty palms, the second-guessing, the relief when you passed? Well, congratulations—you're now qualified to inflict that same experience on others.

That's right. As a General class operator, you can join the ranks of Volunteer Examiners and help shepherd new hams into our hobby. But first, let's understand how this whole licensing machine works.

#### Welcome Back: Credit for Expired Licenses

Life happens. Maybe someone let their license expire during a military deployment, a family crisis, or just plain forgetfulness. The FCC understands:

> *Key Information:* *Partial credit for the elements represented by an expired amateur radio license may be given to any person who can demonstrate that they once held an FCC-issued General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra class license that was not revoked by the FCC.* {{< link id="G1D01" >}}

![Flowchart showing license credit process](../images/license-credit-process.svg)

Note the key words: "not revoked." If the FCC took your license away for bad behavior, no credit for you. But if it simply expired? Welcome back to the family.

Here's how it works:
- Held General or higher? You get credit for Element 2 (Technician written)
- Just need to pass Element 3 to get General privileges back
- No time limit—expired 20 years ago? Still counts

This isn't charity—it's recognition that radio knowledge doesn't completely evaporate. Sure, you might be rusty on the latest digital modes, but you still remember what SWR means.

#### Your New Superpower: Administering Exams

With your shiny General ticket comes a new privilege:

> *Key Information:* *A General class licensee who has been accredited as a Volunteer Examiner may administer Technician examinations only.* {{< link id="G1D02" >}}

![Chart showing VE privileges by license class](../images/ve-privileges-by-class.svg)

The VE hierarchy is simple:
- **Technician VEs**: Don't exist (can't examine anyone)
- **General VEs**: Can administer Technician exams
- **Extra VEs**: Can administer all exam levels

Why can't you give General exams? Same reason students don't grade their own tests—you need to be at least one level above what you're testing.

#### The Magic Paper: Operating with a CSCE

Pass an exam today, but the FCC database won't show your upgrade for days or weeks. Enter the CSCE—your temporary hall pass to expanded privileges:

> *Key Information:* *A Technician class operator who has an unexpired Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) for General class privileges may operate on any General or Technician class band segment.* {{< link id="G1D03" >}}

![Diagram showing CSCE certificate and associated privileges](../images/csce-privileges.svg)

That piece of paper signed by three VEs is your golden ticket. Guard it like your firstborn—it's your only proof of privileges until the FCC updates their database.

But there's a catch. When using CSCE privileges, you need special identification:

> *Key Information:* *Until an upgrade to General class is shown in the FCC database, a Technician must identify with "AG" after their call sign when operating using General class frequency privileges.* {{< link id="G1D06" >}}

So if you're W1ABC with a fresh CSCE, you identify as "W1ABC AG" (AG = Awaiting General). It tells everyone you're legal, just waiting for the paperwork to catch up.

How long is that CSCE good for?

> *Key Information:* *A Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) is valid for exam element credit for 365 days.* {{< link id="G1D09" >}}

One full year. If your upgrade hasn't processed in 365 days, something went seriously wrong. Check if you forgot to pay the fee, spelled your name wrong, or accidentally applied for a fishing license instead.

#### The Three-VE Rule

Amateur radio testing isn't a solo act:

> *Key Information:* *At least three Volunteer Examiners of General class or higher must observe the administration of a Technician class license examination.* {{< link id="G1D04" >}}

![Diagram showing VE session requirements](../images/ve-session-requirements.svg)

Why three? Because two could conspire, but three makes conspiracy complicated. It's the same reason we use three-judge panels—collective oversight prevents individual shenanigans.

All three must:
- Be present for the entire exam
- Check the candidate's identification
- Grade the exam
- Sign the paperwork

No stepping out for coffee while your buddies handle things. You're creating federal licenses here, not running a bake sale.

#### Who's the Boss? VE Accreditation

VEs don't just volunteer—they're accredited:

> *Key Information:* *Volunteer Examiners are accredited by a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator.* {{< link id="G1D07" >}}

VECs are the middlemen between individual VEs and the FCC. Major VECs include:
- ARRL VEC (the 800-pound gorilla)
- W5YI VEC 
- Laurel VEC (famous for free testing)
- Several others

Each VEC has its own procedures, but all must follow FCC rules. It's like different franchises of the same restaurant—the menu might vary, but the health code doesn't.

#### International VEs Welcome

You don't need to be a US citizen to be a VE:

> *Key Information:* *To be an accredited Volunteer Examiner, a non-US citizen must hold an FCC granted amateur radio license of General class or above.* {{< link id="G1D08" >}}

Makes sense—if you're qualified to use the privileges, you're qualified to test others for them. The FCC cares about your radio knowledge, not your passport.

But there is an age requirement:

> *Key Information:* *The minimum age that one must be to qualify as an accredited Volunteer Examiner is 18 years.* {{< link id="G1D10" >}}

Eighteen—old enough to vote, serve in the military, and apparently, administer federal examinations. It's about legal responsibility as much as maturity.

#### The Dreaded Expiration

Licenses expire. It happens. Here's what it takes to get back on the air:

> *Key Information:* *To obtain a new General class license after a previously held license has expired and the two-year grace period has passed, the applicant must show proof of the appropriate expired license grant and pass the current Element 2 exam.* {{< link id="G1D11" >}}

![Flowchart showing license renewal process](../images/license-renewal-process.svg)

The timeline matters:
- **Within 10 years**: Renew online, no questions asked
- **10 years to 12 years (grace period)**: Still renewable, but can't transmit
- **After 12 years**: Show proof of old license, retake Technician exam

Why make expired licensees retake Element 2? Because regulations change, new bands appear, and old timers might think 2 meters is still just for local ragchewing.

#### Cross-Band Repeater Rules

Here's a quirky scenario that tests the limits of license privileges:

> *Key Information:* *When may a 10-meter repeater retransmit the 2-meter signal from a station that has a Technician class control operator? Only if the 10-meter repeater control operator holds at least a General class license.* {{< link id="G1E02" >}}

![Diagram showing cross-band repeater operation requirements](../images/cross-band-repeater-operation.svg)

This seems weird until you think it through:
- Technician talks on 2 meters (where they have privileges)
- Signal goes through a cross-band repeater
- Comes out on 10 meters (where Technicians have limited privileges)
- Repeater control op needs General privileges for 10-meter operation

The repeater's control operator must have privileges for all bands the repeater uses. It's their license on the line if something goes wrong.

#### Becoming a VE: Your Path to Give Back

Ready to join the VE ranks? Here's your roadmap:

**Step 1: Choose Your VEC**
Each has different philosophies:
- Some charge test fees, some don't
- Some focus on in-person, others embrace remote testing
- Some are regional, others national

**Step 2: Study Up**
It's open book, but you still need to know:
- Part 97 rules (especially the testing parts)
- VEC procedures
- How to spot fake IDs (seriously)
- Basic session administration

**Step 3: Get Accredited**
Take the VEC's exam. Yes, another test—but this one's about giving tests, not taking them.

**Step 4: Find Your Team**
Connect with local VEs. Most teams welcome new blood, especially younger VEs who understand online testing.

#### Why Bother Being a VE?

Beyond the warm fuzzies of helping others:

**You Stay Current**: Nothing keeps you sharp like explaining rules to new hams. You'll know Part 97 better than ever.

**You Shape the Future**: Every new ham you test is someone you helped bring into the hobby. Your encouragement during their test might make the difference.

**You Give Back**: Someone volunteered their Saturday to test you. Time to return the favor.

**You Learn Patience**: Nothing tests your zen like explaining for the 47th time why calculator memories must be cleared.

#### The Modern Testing Landscape

The VE system has evolved dramatically:
- **Remote Testing**: Pandemic necessity became permanent option
- **Electronic Filing**: Results to FCC in hours, not weeks  
- **Diverse Locations**: Libraries, churches, hamfests, even parking lots
- **Accommodation**: Extra time, large print, readers for those who need them

We've come a long way from driving to the FCC office for a code test.

#### Your Role in Amateur Radio's Future

That General license in your wallet represents more than personal achievement—it's your membership card in a self-regulating community. Whether you become a VE, mentor new operators, or simply operate responsibly, you're part of the system that keeps amateur radio alive.

The FCC trusts us to test ourselves, police ourselves, and teach ourselves. That trust, earned over decades, is what makes our service unique. Every properly administered exam, every accurately completed form, every patient explanation to a nervous candidate maintains that trust.

Your General journey continues. Maybe Extra class is next. Maybe you'll become the VE team leader everyone depends on. Maybe you'll be the one who encourages a nervous teenager through their first exam.

Whatever path you choose, remember: regulations aren't the destination—they're the framework that lets millions of hams worldwide say those magic words: "CQ, CQ, CQ..."
