## Chapter 7: Setting Up Your HF Station

The bands are alive with signals from around the world, but all you hear is noise. That rare DX station is calling CQ, but they can't hear your response. Your signal reports are "barely readable" while others get "59 plus." The difference isn't luck—it's station setup. Your General ticket unlocks the HF bands, but this chapter unlocks their potential.

We begin where every QSO starts: reception. Master the controls that pull whispers from noise—attenuators that tame local powerhouses, filters that slice through QRM, and techniques that make weak signals jump from the static. No more wondering what you're missing.

Next comes the moment of truth: transmitting. SSB isn't FM with a different name—it's a different beast entirely. Learn why your perfectly good FM habits create terrible SSB signals, how to set up speech processing that cuts through pile-ups, and when to reach for that amplifier switch.

Speaking of amplifiers, your General license authorizes serious power—up to 1500 watts that can span oceans. But with great power comes great responsibility (and potential for expensive mistakes). We'll show you how to tune without destroying tubes, measure without guessing, and radiate cleanly without becoming the neighborhood QRM source.

Then there's the digital revolution. While voice operators struggle with marginal conditions, digital operators work stations they can't even hear. FT8, PSK31, Winlink—each mode opens new possibilities when bands seem dead. Your computer becomes as important as your radio.

Finally, test equipment transforms guesswork into knowledge. That expensive station might be performing terribly, but without proper measurement, you'll never know. Learn which instruments matter most and how to use them effectively.

Ready to build a station that actually delivers on HF's promise? Let's turn those General privileges into real-world contacts.
