## Chapter 6: Safety

That kilowatt amplifier beckons from the hamfest table. The 60-foot tower promises worldwide contacts. Your emergency go-kit needs reliable power when the grid fails. But every one of these General-class dreams carries risks that can end your ham radio career—or worse—in seconds. Master safety now, because the best DX is the contact you live to tell about.

Safety separates competent operators from statistics. Your General privileges unlock power levels and antenna systems that demand respect. AC mains that can stop hearts. Towers where gravity never sleeps. Batteries that become bombs when mistreated. Lightning that sees your antenna as an invitation. RF energy that silently heats tissue beyond safe limits.

This chapter transforms safety from rules to reflex. You'll discover how proper circuit protection prevents fires, why ground fault protection saves lives, and when the National Electrical Code becomes your best friend. We explore portable power systems that keep you on the air when others go dark, from deep-cycle batteries to solar panels to generators—each with unique hazards to manage.

When antennas need altitude, we reveal the climbing techniques and safety gear that stand between you and disaster. Grounding gets demystified as we untangle RF grounds, safety grounds, and lightning grounds—similar names, different purposes, all critical. Finally, we tackle the invisible hazard of RF exposure, showing you how to calculate, measure, and mitigate the fields your station creates.

Real stories from real hams illustrate why these precautions matter. The operator whose proper bonding prevented electrocution. The tower climber whose harness saved his life. The portable station that avoided carbon monoxide poisoning. The antenna system that survived a direct lightning strike. Each tale reinforces that safety isn't paranoia—it's preparation.

Ready to operate with confidence? Let's build safety habits that protect you while you pursue the magic of radio!
