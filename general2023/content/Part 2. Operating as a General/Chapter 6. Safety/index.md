## Chapter 6: Safety

Your new General class privileges open exciting doors—higher power, more complex antenna systems, and potentially high-voltage equipment—all of which come with additional safety considerations beyond what you learned as a Technician.

In this chapter, we'll cover the safety aspects that matter most for General class operators. We'll explore AC power safety for your growing station, examine battery and alternative power systems for portable and emergency operations, and discuss comprehensive grounding approaches that protect both equipment and operators.

For those considering tower-mounted antennas, we'll share critical safety practices for installation and maintenance work. We'll also tackle RF exposure management—increasingly important as you access higher power levels and new frequency bands.

Safety isn't the most glamorous topic in ham radio, but it's essential for enjoying the hobby long-term. The knowledge you gain here will help you create a station that's not only capable but also safe for you, your family, and your community.

Let's build safe habits that become second nature in all your amateur radio activities!
