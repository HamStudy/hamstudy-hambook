### Section 6.4: Tower and Antenna Safety

With your General class privileges, you might be eyeing more substantial antenna systems to take advantage of your expanded HF access. The lure of bigger antennas often leads to the consideration of towers—and with that comes one of the most physically dangerous aspects of amateur radio. In this section, we'll cover best practices for staying safe when working at heights.

#### The Gravity of Tower Safety

Let's be blunt: tower work is inherently dangerous. Falls from height remain one of the leading causes of serious injury and death in various industries, and amateur radio is no exception. The difference between professional tower climbers and amateurs is often training, equipment, and frequency of practice—all areas where we hams need to be especially vigilant.

A fall from as little as 10 feet can be fatal. At tower heights of 40, 60, or 100+ feet, mistakes are simply not an option. The good news is that with proper equipment, procedures, and attitudes, tower work can be conducted safely.

#### Proper Climbing Equipment

The most basic safety requirement for tower climbing is proper safety equipment:

> **Key Information:** *When climbing a tower using a safety harness, you should confirm that the harness is rated for the weight of the climber and that it is within its allowable service life.* {{< link id="G0B07" >}}

A proper climbing harness for tower work is not the same as a recreational climbing harness or a basic fall-arrest belt. Tower climbing harnesses typically include:

1. **Full-body design** that distributes force across your body if you fall
2. **Multiple attachment points** for positioning lanyards and fall arrest
3. **Comfortable padding** for extended work periods
4. **Tool loops and attachment points** for equipment

Always check your harness before each climb:
- Inspect for fraying, cuts, or damage to webbing
- Check that buckles and hardware are functional and not damaged
- Verify the manufacturing date and retirement date (most harnesses have a 5-year service life from first use)
- Ensure that the weight rating exceeds your weight plus the weight of tools and equipment you'll carry

##### Beyond the Harness: Complete Safety Equipment

A proper harness is just the start. Complete tower safety equipment includes:

1. **Positioning Lanyard**: Allows you to "tie off" and work hands-free
2. **Fall Arrest Lanyard**: Typically includes a shock absorber to reduce forces in a fall
3. **Hard Hat**: Protects against falling objects and head impacts
4. **Safety Glasses**: Shields eyes from debris
5. **Gloves**: Provides grip and protection
6. **Appropriate Footwear**: Offers traction and support
7. **Tool Tethers**: Prevents dropped tools that could injure ground crew

Never climb without complete safety equipment, properly worn and adjusted. The money spent on quality gear is trivial compared to the potential cost of an accident.

#### The Ground Crew: Your Safety Lifeline

While proper equipment is essential, perhaps the most critical safety element is one that many hams overlook:

> **Key Information:** *It is never safe to climb a tower without a helper or observer present.* {{< link id="G0B03" >}}

<img src="../images/tower-ground-crew.svg" alt="Diagram showing tower climber with ground crew" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

The ground crew serves multiple vital functions:
- Watches for developing hazards the climber might not see
- Provides assistance with tools and materials using haul lines
- Maintains communication with the climber
- Can summon help immediately in an emergency
- Helps manage materials and equipment on the ground

Even the most experienced tower climbers always work with a ground crew. This isn't an optional safety measure—it's an absolute requirement, regardless of how "simple" or "quick" the job might seem.

A story drives this point home: A ham I know decided to make a "quick adjustment" to his antenna without calling a friend to help. He slipped and, although his safety harness prevented a fall, he was left hanging and unable to climb back up. With no ground crew, he hung there for over three hours before his wife came home and called for help. A ground crew would have prevented this dangerous situation entirely.

#### Power Line Safety: A Matter of Life and Death

While falls are a significant hazard, they're not the only danger when working with towers and antennas. Contact with power lines is an even more immediately lethal risk:

> **Key Information:** *Before climbing a tower that supports electrically powered devices, make sure all circuits that supply power to the tower are locked out and tagged.* {{< link id="G0B08" >}}

<img src="../images/lockout-tagout.svg" alt="Diagram showing proper lockout-tagout procedure for tower power" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

This "lockout-tagout" procedure physically prevents the accidental re-energizing of electrical circuits while you're working on the tower. It typically involves:

1. Turning off the circuit at the breaker or disconnect
2. Applying a lock that physically prevents the circuit from being turned back on
3. Attaching a tag that identifies who placed the lock and why
4. Verifying that the circuit is indeed de-energized before beginning work

This procedure is particularly important for towers with powered elements like:
- Tower-mounted preamplifiers
- Rotator systems
- Antenna tuning units
- Tower lighting

Even if someone knows you're working on the tower, accidents can happen—someone might flip a breaker without thinking or assume you've finished work. Physical lockout is the only reliable protection.

Beyond equipment on the tower itself, always maintain safe distances from utility power lines:

1. **Before Installation**: Plan tower and antenna locations to maintain suitable distance from power lines—even if the antenna were to fall during installation
2. **During Raising**: Be especially careful when raising masts, poles, or tower sections
3. **During Maintenance**: Always check overhead and nearby for power lines before beginning work

*No* antenna is worth risking contact with power lines. If there's any doubt about clearance or safety, consult a professional or choose a different location.

#### Special Considerations for Crank-Up Towers

If you're working with a crank-up (telescoping) tower, additional safety precautions are necessary:

> **Key Information:** *A crank-up tower must not be climbed unless it is in a fully retracted position or mechanical safety locking devices have been installed.* {{< link id="G0B07" >}}

Crank-up towers have nested sections that can collapse if the winch or cable fails, or if safety mechanisms aren't properly engaged. Never rely solely on the winch or cable to maintain tower extension while climbing.

<img src="../images/crank-up-tower-safety.svg" alt="Diagram showing proper safety measures for crank-up towers" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

If you must climb a crank-up tower in an extended position:
1. Verify that safety pins or mechanical locking devices are properly inserted at each section
2. Check that these locking devices are designed for the purpose (don't improvise with bolts or other makeshift solutions)
3. Consider adding temporary guy wires for additional stability
4. Have your ground crew continuously monitor the tower condition

#### Planning Your Tower Work

Safe tower work begins long before you start climbing. Proper planning includes:

1. **Weather Check**: Never climb in high winds, rain, snow, or if lightning is possible
2. **Physical Preparation**: Make sure you're well-rested, properly hydrated, and not taking medications that might affect balance or awareness
3. **Task Planning**: Know exactly what you need to do before climbing
4. **Tool Organization**: Prepare and check all tools, ensuring they can be safely transported up the tower
5. **Communication Plan**: Establish clear signals or communication methods with your ground crew
6. **Emergency Plan**: Know what to do if something goes wrong

Remember that fatigue is a major contributor to accidents. Plan your work to avoid extended periods on the tower, and don't hesitate to descend, rest, and resume later if needed.

#### The Climbing Mindset

Perhaps the most important aspect of tower safety is maintaining the right mindset:

1. **Never Rush**: There's no such thing as a tower emergency that requires rushing and cutting corners on safety
2. **Three Points of Contact**: Always maintain three points of contact with the tower when moving (two feet and one hand, or two hands and one foot)
3. **Stay Clipped In**: Remain connected to the tower with at least one lanyard at all times
4. **Check Everything Twice**: Develop the habit of double-checking connections, tools, and safety equipment
5. **Avoid Distractions**: Stay focused on the task and your safety
6. **Say No When Necessary**: Be willing to postpone work if conditions aren't right

Tower work requires a disciplined, methodical approach. The old aviation saying applies perfectly to tower climbing: "It's better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the air wishing you were on the ground."

#### Know Your Limits

Not everyone needs to be a tower climber. If you're uncomfortable with heights, have physical limitations, or simply prefer to keep your feet on the ground, that's perfectly fine! Many successful stations are built without their owners ever climbing a tower.

Alternatives to climbing yourself include:
- Hiring professional tower services
- Finding experienced hams in your club who enjoy tower work
- Using ground-mounted or roof-mounted antennas that don't require tower climbing
- Focusing on antenna designs that can be lowered for maintenance

Remember that your General license privileges can be fully enjoyed with antennas that never require you to leave the ground.

#### The Bottom Line: Tower Safety Is Non-Negotiable

Tower safety isn't about following rules just to check boxes—it's about ensuring you'll be around to enjoy many more years of ham radio. The risks are real, but they can be managed with proper equipment, procedures, and attitudes.

If you do choose to work on towers, invest in proper training. Many amateur radio clubs offer tower safety workshops, and there are professional courses available as well. The ARRL and many ham radio websites offer detailed guidance on tower safety that goes beyond what we can cover here.

Remember that no antenna, no contact, and no contest is worth risking your life. Plan carefully, work methodically, and always prioritize safety over expediency.

In the next section, we'll discuss RF exposure safety—a less visible but equally important aspect of amateur radio safety.
