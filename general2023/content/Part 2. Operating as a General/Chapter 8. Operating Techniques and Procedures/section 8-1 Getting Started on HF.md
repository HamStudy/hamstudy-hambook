### Section 8.1: Getting Started on HF

With your new General class privileges, you now have access to the fascinating world of High Frequency (HF) communications. Gone are the days when your contacts were limited to local repeaters or line-of-sight simplex. Now you can talk around the world using the ionosphere as your radio signal's natural relay. Let's explore the fundamentals of HF operation that will help you make successful contacts across the continent and around the globe.

#### Understanding HF Voice Modes

As a Technician, you likely focused on FM operation on VHF and UHF bands. On HF, single sideband (SSB) is the primary voice mode, and it works quite differently from FM. Here's what you need to know:

##### Sideband Selection: USB vs. LSB

> **Key Information:** *Upper sideband (USB) is most commonly used for voice communications on frequencies of 14 MHz or higher.* {{< link id="G2A01" >}}

<img src="../images/sideband-selection.svg" alt="Diagram showing which sidebands are used on different bands" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;">

The HF bands follow a convention for which sideband to use:

> **Key Information:** *Lower sideband (LSB) is most commonly used for voice communications on the 160-, 75-, and 40-meter bands.* {{< link id="G2A02" >}}

This pattern continues into the VHF range:

> **Key Information:** *Upper sideband (USB) is most commonly used for SSB voice communications in the VHF and UHF bands.* {{< link id="G2A03" >}}

For the less commonly used bands:

> **Key Information:** *Upper sideband (USB) is most commonly used for voice communications on the 17- and 12-meter bands.* {{< link id="G2A04" >}}

This sideband convention is important because using the wrong sideband will make your audio sound unintelligible to other operators. Think of it as a community standard that everyone follows to ensure smooth communication.

The simple rule of thumb is: 
- **LSB**: Use on 160, 75, and 40 meters (below 10 MHz)
- **USB**: Use on 20, 17, 15, 12, 10 meters and all VHF/UHF bands (10 MHz and above)
- **Exception**: 60 meters uses USB despite being below 10 MHz

Why do we use LSB on lower bands and USB on higher bands? This is primarily a historical convention that began with equipment limitations of early SSB transceivers, but it's now firmly established as operating practice.

##### Advantages of SSB

You'll quickly notice that SSB sounds different from FM. There's no squelch to eliminate background noise, and voices may initially sound "Donald Duck-like" until you fine-tune the frequency. Despite these differences, SSB offers significant advantages for HF operation:

> **Key Information:** *Single sideband is the most commonly used voice mode on the HF amateur bands.* {{< link id="G2A05" >}}

> **Key Information:** *Less bandwidth used and greater power efficiency are advantages of single sideband compared to other analog voice modes on the HF amateur bands.* {{< link id="G2A06" >}}

<img src="../images/ssb-bandwidth-efficiency.svg" alt="Diagram showing SSB efficiency compared to other voice modes" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

SSB transmits only one sideband of the amplitude-modulated signal, eliminating the carrier and other sideband:

> **Key Information:** *In single sideband, only one sideband is transmitted while the carrier and other sideband are suppressed.* {{< link id="G2A07" >}}

This efficiency translates to:
- Using approximately 1/3 the bandwidth of AM
- Concentrating power in the information-carrying part of the signal
- Better performance under marginal conditions
- More efficient use of limited spectrum space

Understanding these efficiency advantages helps explain why most HF voice operation uses SSB rather than AM or even FM for long-distance communication.

##### Why Most Amateur Stations Use LSB on Lower Bands

If you're wondering why there's this division between upper and lower bands:

> **Key Information:** *Most amateur stations use lower sideband on the 160-, 75-, and 40-meter bands because it is commonly accepted practice, not due to technical advantages.* {{< link id="G2A09" >}}

While the convention began partly due to early equipment designs, today it's simply standard practice. Using the opposite sideband will make your transmission sound unintelligible to others listening with the conventional sideband selected.

#### Choosing Frequencies and Making Contacts

With numerous frequencies available across multiple bands, how do you decide where to operate?

##### Following Band Plans

Band plans are voluntary guidelines developed by the amateur community to coordinate different activities within the bands:

> **Key Information:** *Following the voluntary band plan for the operating mode you are using is commonly accepted amateur practice when choosing a frequency on which to initiate a call.* {{< link id="G2B07" >}}

<img src="../images/bandplan-example.svg" alt="Sample band plan showing different mode segments" style="width: 450px; margin: 10px;">

Band plans typically divide each band into segments for different modes and activities:
- CW/digital modes at the lower end
- SSB phone in the middle portions
- Special interest modes or activities in designated segments

Consulting a current band plan before operating helps maintain harmony on the bands and ensures you're operating where others expect to find your mode.

##### Special Operating Segments

Some frequency ranges have special purposes:

> **Key Information:** *In the 50.1 MHz to 50.125 MHz band segment, stations within the 48 contiguous states should only contact stations not within the 48 contiguous states.* {{< link id="G2B08" >}}

This segment is reserved for DX (long distance) contacts. Stations in the continental US should use it only to contact stations outside the continental US, preserving this spectrum for intercontinental communication opportunities.

Similar special-purpose segments exist on other bands, including:
- DX windows
- Contest-preferred frequencies
- Digital mode clusters
- QRP (low power) calling frequencies

Always check band plans and special operating guidelines for the band you're using.

#### Practical Tips for Getting Started on HF

Now that you understand the basics, here are some practical suggestions for your first HF adventures:

##### Listening First

Before transmitting, spend time listening to different bands. This helps you:
- Learn the rhythm and etiquette of HF contacts
- Identify active frequencies and band openings
- Understand typical signal reports and exchanges
- Get comfortable with SSB reception
- Identify where the DX (distant) stations are operating

Most successful HF operators spend far more time listening than transmitting. This practice builds knowledge of propagation patterns and operating conventions.

##### Making Your First HF Contacts

When you're ready to transmit:

1. **Choose an appropriate band** based on time of day and current conditions:
   - Daytime: 20, 17, 15, 12, 10 meters often work best
   - Nighttime: 80, 60, 40 meters typically offer better propagation
   - 30 meters can work throughout day and night

2. **Find a clear frequency** by listening carefully for at least 30 seconds, then asking "Is this frequency in use?" followed by your callsign.

3. **Call CQ** using this format:
   "CQ CQ CQ, this is [your callsign], [phonetically spell callsign], calling CQ and standing by."
   
   For example: "CQ CQ CQ, this is WB6ABC, Whiskey Bravo Six Alpha Bravo Charlie, calling CQ and standing by."

4. **Responding to a CQ** requires a different approach:
   - Wait for the station to finish calling
   - Give the other station's callsign once, followed by your callsign phonetically
   
   For example: "W1XYZ, this is WB6ABC, Whiskey Bravo Six Alpha Bravo Charlie."

5. **Exchange information** typically including:
   - Signal report (using the RS system: Readability 1-5, Strength 1-9)
   - Your location (city and state or country)
   - Your name
   - Brief description of your equipment (optional)

6. **End the contact** with a courteous sign-off:
   "Thanks for the contact, [callsign]. This is WB6ABC, clear."

##### Recommended First HF Bands

For your first HF experiences:

- **20 meters (14.0-14.350 MHz)** is often called the "workhorse band" because it frequently offers good propagation throughout the day and across seasons. The General class phone segment starts at 14.225 MHz.

- **40 meters (7.0-7.3 MHz)** provides reliable medium-distance communications during daylight and excellent long-distance potential at night. The General class phone segment starts at 7.175 MHz.

- **10 meters (28.0-29.7 MHz)** can offer exceptional worldwide propagation when open (mostly during solar cycle peaks) and uses equipment and antennas similar to VHF. The General class phone segment starts at 28.3 MHz.

#### Developing Your HF Approach

HF operation is an art that rewards patience and consistent practice. Unlike the reliable, noise-free qualities of local FM repeaters, HF offers the excitement of variable conditions, distant contacts, and the occasional surprise opening to rare locations.

Don't be discouraged if your first attempts at HF contacts aren't immediately successful. Even experienced operators sometimes spend hours calling without a response when conditions are poor. With time, you'll develop an intuitive feel for when and where to operate for the best results.

Remember that every successful HF contact you make represents a genuine achievementâ€”your signal has likely traveled thousands of miles, bouncing off the ionosphere and reaching across continents or oceans. That's the special magic of HF that keeps operators coming back decade after decade.

In the next section, we'll explore more advanced voice operating techniques that will help you make the most of challenging band conditions and special operating situations.
