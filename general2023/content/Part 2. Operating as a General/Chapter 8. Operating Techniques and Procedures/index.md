## Chapter 8: Operating Procedures

Understanding proper operating procedures is essential both for passing your General class exam and for preparing you to use the new privileges you'll gain. This chapter covers key exam topics while providing practical knowledge you'll need when you upgrade.

We'll begin with HF voice operation fundamentals, including the required sideband selections for different frequency bands and proper techniques for establishing contacts. You'll learn voice operating procedures that appear on the exam, such as breaking into conversations, proper ALC settings, and concepts like QRP operation.

CW procedures, DX operations, contesting, digital modes, and emergency communications are all represented in the question pool, with each section contributing questions to the exam. While only one question from each question pool section will appear on your exam, understanding these topics thoroughly prepares you for whatever specific questions you encounter.

Even more importantly, these operating skills will be immediately relevant once you earn your upgrade and begin exploring the HF bands. By learning these procedures now, you'll not only be ready for exam questions but also equipped with practical knowledge that will help you become an effective General class operator from your very first HF contact.
