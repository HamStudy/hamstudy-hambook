Your General class license opens up a world of new operating opportunities across the HF bands. This chapter equips you with the essential techniques and procedures you'll need to make the most of these expanded privileges, from basic voice contacts to specialized digital modes and emergency communications.

We'll begin by exploring the fundamentals of HF operationâ€”understanding which sideband to use on different bands, how to properly call CQ, and the established conventions that keep HF operation smooth and efficient. You'll learn the critical differences between HF SSB and the FM operation you're familiar with from VHF/UHF bands.

Building on these basics, we'll delve into specialized operating techniques including CW procedures with their unique Q-signals and prosigns, DX and contest operating strategies, and the exciting world of digital modes from traditional RTTY to modern weak-signal protocols like FT8. Each mode offers unique advantages and challenges that expand your communication toolkit.

The chapter concludes with emergency communication procedures, where your General class privileges can make a life-saving difference. You'll learn how amateur radio serves communities during disasters and how to effectively participate in emergency networks.

Throughout this chapter, you'll find not just the exam material you need to pass your test, but practical operating wisdom that will serve you well as you explore the expanded world of HF communication that awaits with your General class license.
