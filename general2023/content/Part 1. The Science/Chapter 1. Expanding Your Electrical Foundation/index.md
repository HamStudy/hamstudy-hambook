# Chapter 1: Building Your Electrical Foundation

Congrats on taking the next step in your ham radio journey! Your Technician license has already opened doors to the exciting world of radio communication—now it's time to level up with your General class license.

Think of this upgrade as unlocking a whole new level in your radio adventure—suddenly the worldwide HF bands become your playground! You'll be making contacts across continents, exploring digital modes, and becoming a valuable emergency communicator. But to truly master these new privileges, you'll need a stronger grip on the electrical concepts that make it all work.

In this chapter, we'll build on what you already know and dive into how components work together, explore AC circuits, understand resonance, and learn about impedance matching—all skills that will make you a more capable operator who can build, modify, and troubleshoot equipment with confidence.

Don't worry if some of this sounds challenging! We'll break everything down into bite-sized concepts with real-world ham radio applications. We're focusing not just on the "what" but the "why," helping you develop an intuition that goes beyond memorizing facts for a test.
