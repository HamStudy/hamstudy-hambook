# Supplement: What's New in the 2026 Question Pool

If you studied using the 2022-2026 Technician HamBook but expect to test on or after July 1, 2026 with the 2026-2030 Technician class question pool, this supplement is for you! The new pool introduces several updated and brand-new questions covering topics that weren't included before. This chapter walks you through all the new material you'll need to know. Note that there are a lot of wording changes on other questions not covered here, but they weren't considered significant enough to need extra focus.

Don't worry—everything you learned from the 2022 book still applies. This section is just a refresher with a focus on the specific wording and topics covered by the new questions for those who are nervous.

## Licensing and Regulations

### How You'll Hear About Your New License

> **Key Information:** You receive official notification of your new license and call sign via *email from the FCC with a link to download the license grant*. {{< link id="T1A04" >}}

After you pass your exam, your volunteer examiner (VE) team submits your application through their VEC (Volunteer Examiner Coordinator). The FCC then sends you an email with information about paying the licensing fee, and once that's complete, another email arrives with a link to download your official license grant.

### Renewing Your License Early

> **Key Information:** You can renew your license as early as *ninety (90) days* before it expires. {{< link id="T1C07" >}}

Planning ahead? The FCC lets you renew your license up to 90 days before the expiration date. This gives you plenty of buffer room to avoid any last-minute scrambles.

### Operating from Ships and International Waters

> **Key Information:** You may operate your amateur radio from a *US-documented vessel in international waters* with the *master's permission*. {{< link id="T1C06" >}}

If you're aboard a vessel that's documented or registered in the United States and you're in international waters, you can operate your amateur station—just make sure you have the ship's captain on board with the idea.

### Interference is Never Okay

> **Key Information:** *Willful or malicious interference* to other amateur radio stations is *prohibited*—always, under all circumstances. {{< link id="T1A11" >}}

Intentional interference violates both FCC rules and the spirit of amateur radio. The bands belong to everyone, and mutual respect keeps the hobby functioning smoothly.

## Station Control

### What's a Control Operator?

> **Key Information:** A *control operator* is an amateur operator *designated by the licensee of a station to be responsible for transmissions and FCC rules compliance* at that station. {{< link id="T1E11" >}}

Every amateur station needs a control operator—someone who takes responsibility for ensuring that all transmissions comply with FCC rules.

### Remote Control

> **Key Information:** *Any amateur station* may be remotely controlled. {{< link id="T1E09" >}}

You're not limited to sitting right next to your radio! Any amateur station can be operated remotely. The key requirement is that the control operator must be able to maintain proper control of the station at all times.

### Auxiliary Stations

> **Key Information:** An example of an *auxiliary station* is one *sending one-way transmissions between a remote repeater receiver and the main repeater transmitter*. {{< link id="T1D07" >}}

Think of auxiliary stations as support stations—links in a larger system, like a radio link connecting a remote receiver site to a repeater's main transmitter.

## Electronic Fundamentals

### Amplifier Gain

> **Key Information:** *Gain* in amplifiers can refer to the ratio of output to input *voltage, current, or power*—all are valid ways to measure how much a signal is amplified. {{< link id="T6B11" >}}

When we talk about an amplifier's "gain," we're describing how much it increases a signal. Gain can be measured as voltage gain, current gain, or power gain—all three are legitimate ways to express amplification.

---

## Propagation

### Speed of Radio Waves

> **Key Information:** *All radio frequencies travel at the same velocity* in free space—whether VHF, UHF, microwaves, or any other frequency. {{< link id="T3B12" >}}

In the vacuum of space, all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed—the speed of light. A 2-meter VHF signal and a 23-cm UHF signal zip along at exactly the same velocity: about 300 million meters per second.

### The Ionosphere

> **Key Information:** The *ionosphere* is the region of the atmosphere that can *reflect HF radio waves*. {{< link id="T3A11" >}}

The ionosphere makes long-distance HF communication possible by bouncing signals back to Earth. Note that the exam uses the term "reflect" here—while some argue "refract" is more technically accurate for what the ionosphere does, the concept is the same: the ionosphere is what enables skywave propagation on HF.

### Auroral Backscatter

> **Key Information:** VHF signals received via auroral backscatter are *distorted, with a characteristic raspy sound*. {{< link id="T3C03" >}}

When VHF signals bounce off the aurora, they come back sounding rough and raspy—quite different from normal clear signals. This distinctive sound is a telltale sign of auroral propagation.

### HF Propagation Beacons

> **Key Information:** On HF, *automatically controlled amateur propagation beacons* can be found on *10 meters, between 28.200 MHz and 28.300 MHz*. {{< link id="T1A06" >}}

Propagation beacons are automated stations that transmit signals so operators can assess band conditions. By tuning to 28.200–28.300 MHz and listening for distant beacons, you can quickly tell whether 10 meters is "open" for long-distance communication.

---

## Antennas

### Antenna Polarization

> **Key Information:** The *polarization* of an antenna is described by the *orientation of the electric field*. {{< link id="T9A03" >}}

When we talk about antenna polarization, we're describing the orientation of the radio wave's electric field. A vertical antenna produces vertically polarized waves; a horizontal antenna produces horizontally polarized waves.

### The 19-Inch 2-Meter Antenna

> **Key Information:** A *19-inch vertical antenna* is often used on 2 meters because *it is a resonant quarter-wave* at that frequency. {{< link id="T9A08" >}}

At 146 MHz (in the heart of the 2-meter band), a quarter wavelength works out to approximately 19 inches. This is why vertical antennas for 2-meter handhelds and mobile radios are roughly this size.

### Weatherproofing Outdoor Connectors

> **Key Information:** *All outdoor RF connectors* (PL-259, BNC, Type N, and others) should be *carefully taped or sealed for weather protection*. {{< link id="T9B01" >}}

Any connector exposed to the elements needs protection from moisture. Whether you're using PL-259s, BNCs, or Type N connectors, take the time to properly seal them with self-amalgamating tape or weatherproof boots.

## Station Equipment and Troubleshooting

### The VFO

> **Key Information:** The function of the *Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO)* is to *set the receive and transmit frequency*. {{< link id="T7A11" >}}

The VFO is what lets you tune around the bands. When you turn the tuning knob on your transceiver, you're adjusting the VFO.

### How an Ohmmeter Works

> **Key Information:** An ohmmeter measures resistance by *applying a small current and measuring the resulting voltage*. {{< link id="T7D05" >}}

Your multimeter's ohmmeter function uses Ohm's Law: it applies a known, small current to the component being tested and measures the voltage that develops across it to calculate resistance.

### Dummy Loads

> **Key Information:** A typical RF dummy load consists of a *50-ohm non-inductive resistor mounted on a heat sink*. {{< link id="T7C03" >}}

Dummy loads let you test your transmitter without radiating a signal. The 50-ohm rating matches standard amateur radio impedance, and the non-inductive design ensures it works properly at RF frequencies.

### When SWR Gets High

> **Key Information:** *High SWR* is a common cause of *low RF power output* from a solid-state transceiver. {{< link id="T7B04" >}}

Modern solid-state transceivers have protection circuits that automatically reduce output power when SWR rises too high. If your radio isn't putting out as much power as expected, check your antenna system!

### Fixing Distorted Audio with Ferrite Chokes

> **Key Information:** Adding a *clip-on ferrite choke to the microphone cable* can eliminate distorted voice transmissions by preventing RF feedback into the transmitter. {{< link id="T7B11" >}}

If you're getting reports of garbled or distorted audio, RF from your transmitter might be sneaking back into your audio circuits. Snapping a ferrite choke onto your microphone cable often fixes this.

### Coaxial Cable: Foam vs. Solid Dielectric

> **Key Information:** *Foam-dielectric* coaxial cable has *less loss per foot* than solid-dielectric cable. {{< link id="T7C11" >}}

Foam dielectric has tiny air bubbles that reduce signal loss. The tradeoff is that foam-dielectric cables are somewhat more susceptible to moisture damage, so proper weatherproofing at connections is essential.

## Digital Modes and Operating

### Digital Modes for Technicians

> **Key Information:** Technician class operators can use digital modes such as FT8 on *10 meters, 6 meters, and 2 meters*. {{< link id="T1B05" >}}

Digital modes like FT8 allow weak signal contacts that would be impossible with voice. As a Technician, you have digital privileges on multiple bands right from the start!

### FT8 Station Setup

> **Key Information:** For FT8 operation, the transceiver's audio input and output connect to the *audio output and input of a computer running FT8 software*. {{< link id="T4A04" >}}

FT8 requires connecting your radio's audio to a computer. The exam now refers generically to "FT8 software" rather than the specific program WSJT-X, though WSJT-X remains the most popular choice.

### FM Voice Peaks

> **Key Information:** Talking *too loudly* will cause your FM transmission audio to *drop out on voice peaks*. {{< link id="T2B05" >}}

When you speak too loudly into an FM transmitter, you over-deviate the signal and the audio drops out on peaks. Keep your voice level moderate for clean audio.

### DMR Color Codes

> **Key Information:** A DMR *color code* is an *access code which must be programmed into a DMR transmitter to access a specific repeater*. {{< link id="T2B12" >}}

Think of a color code as a key that unlocks a particular DMR repeater—your radio's color code setting must match the repeater's code, or the repeater won't respond to your transmissions.

### DMR Code Plugs

> **Key Information:** A DMR *"code plug"* is *configuration data loaded onto your radio to access repeaters and talkgroups*. {{< link id="T4B07" >}}

A code plug is a configuration file containing all the information your DMR radio needs: repeater frequencies, color codes, talkgroup IDs, and more.

### Calling CQ

> **Key Information:** An effective way to seek a call from any phone station when not using a repeater is to *repeat "CQ" a few times, followed by "this is" and your call sign, then pause to listen*. {{< link id="T2A06" >}}

"CQ" is amateur radio's universal "calling all stations" signal. Say "CQ" two or three times, give your callsign, pause and listen for responses, then repeat as necessary.

---

## Satellites

### Understanding LEO

> **Key Information:** *LEO* stands for *Low Earth Orbit*—a satellite orbit with a *period of around 100 minutes*. {{< link id="T8B10" >}}

Most amateur radio satellites are LEO satellites, zipping around Earth relatively close to the surface. Because they're moving fast, each pass typically only lasts 5 to 15 minutes—so you've got to be quick!

---

## Emergency Communications

### RACES Requirements

> **Key Information:** To be the control operator of a RACES station, you need both an *FCC-issued amateur operator license* and *certification of current enrollment by a civil defense organization*. {{< link id="T1A10" >}} {{< link id="T2C12" >}}

RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service) operates under civil defense authority during declared emergencies. Unlike ARES, which is volunteer-based, RACES requires that additional civil defense certification.

### Winlink: Email Over Radio

> **Key Information:** *Winlink* relays messages using *email addresses based on amateur callsigns*. {{< link id="T2C08" >}}

Winlink is a global radio email system where each amateur gets an email address based on their callsign (like W1ABC@winlink.org). During disasters when internet infrastructure fails, Winlink provides critical communication capability.
