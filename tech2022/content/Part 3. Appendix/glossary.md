3. Readable with considerable difficulty
4. Readable with practically no difficulty
5. Perfectly readable

**Strength (1-9)**:

2. Very weak signals
3. Weak signals
4. Fair signals
5. Fairly good signals
6. Good signals
7. Moderately strong signals
8. Strong signals
9. Extremely strong signals

**Tone (1-9)** (used only for CW/Morse code):
1. Extremely rough hissing note
2. Very rough AC note, no trace of musicality
3. Rough AC note, slightly musical
