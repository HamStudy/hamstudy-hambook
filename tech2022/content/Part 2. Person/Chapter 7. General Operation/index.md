## Chapter 7: Operating Practices

Welcome to the heart of amateur radio - actually getting on the air and making contacts! In this chapter, we'll discuss the practical aspects of operating your station and communicating with other hams around the world.

We'll start with the fundamentals of FM operation, the mode you'll likely use most as a new Technician. You'll learn everything from calling procedures to handling signal issues, and understanding the quirks that make FM unique.

Next, we'll explore HF operation, giving you a taste of what's possible with your Technician privileges on the 10-meter band. Although your HF access is limited for now, this knowledge will be valuable both for the exam and for future adventures if you upgrade.

We'll also delve into public service and emergency communications - a proud tradition in amateur radio. You'll discover how organizations like ARES and RACES work, and how hams provide crucial communication support during disasters when other systems fail.

For those with an eye toward the sky, we'll introduce satellite operation - yes, as a Technician, you can communicate through satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth! We'll cover the basics of tracking, operating modes, and making that first thrilling space contact.

Finally, we'll explore fun activities like radio direction finding (fox hunting), contesting, and using grid locators. These engaging pursuits combine technical skills with friendly competition and outdoor adventure.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation in amateur radio operating practices across a variety of modes and settings. You'll be ready to key up your mic with confidence, knowing you're part of a global community of communicators.

So, let's tune up and get ready to join the conversation on the airwaves!
