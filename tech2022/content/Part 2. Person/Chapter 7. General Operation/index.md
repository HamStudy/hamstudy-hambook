We'll start with the basics of how to make a contact, covering everything from calling CQ to exchanging signal reports. You'll learn about operating protocols and etiquette that help keep the airwaves friendly and organized.

Next, we'll explore different types of operation. We'll cover voice modes like FM and SSB, showing you how to get the most out of each. For those interested in digital modes, we'll introduce popular options like FT8 and discuss how they're changing the face of amateur radio.

We'll also delve into the world of public service and emergency communications, a proud tradition in amateur radio. You'll learn how hams provide crucial communication support during disasters and how you can get involved.

Special event stations, contests, and awards programs add an extra layer of excitement to the hobby, and we'll show you how to participate in these activities.

For those with a technical bent, we'll discuss station logging, both paper and electronic, and introduce you to the concept of QSL cards - the ham radio equivalent of collecting postcards from your on-air travels.
