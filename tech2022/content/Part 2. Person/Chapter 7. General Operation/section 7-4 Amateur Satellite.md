### Section 7.4: Amateur Satellite Operation

Alright, space cadets, strap in for a journey to the final frontier of ham radio - satellite operation! Yes, you heard that right. As a Technician, you can communicate through satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth, extending your radio's reach beyond the horizon and potentially around the globe. How cool is that?

> **Key Information:** *According to FCC Part 97, a space station is an amateur station located more than 50 km above Earth's surface.* *Any amateur holding a Technician class or higher license can communicate through amateur satellites.*

#### What are Amateur Satellites?

Amateur satellites, often called "OSCAR" (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio), are like space-based repeaters. They receive signals on one frequency (uplink) and retransmit them on another (downlink). It's like playing cosmic ping-pong with your radio waves!

*A LEO satellite is a satellite in low earth orbit*, typically between 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth. These space speedsters zip around Earth and pass overhead several times a day. Each pass only lasts 5 to 15 minutes, so you've got to be quick! Most amateur satellites, including the popular FM ones, are LEOs.

> **Key Information:** Satellites use different bands for receiving and transmitting. "U/V mode" means the satellite uplink is in the 70 cm band (UHF) and the downlink is in the 2 meter band (VHF).

#### Satellite Beacons and Telemetry

Satellite beacons are special transmissions that satellites send out regularly, like a space-based lighthouse. *These beacons typically transmit telemetry data about the health and status of the satellite.* This can include battery voltage levels, temperature readings, operating mode, and spacecraft orientation.

*Anyone can receive telemetry from a space station* - these transmissions aren't encrypted and are meant to be monitored by amateur operators worldwide.

#### Satellite Signal Characteristics: Spin Fading

*Spin fading of satellite signals is caused by rotation of the satellite and its antennas.* As a satellite rotates in space, its antennas change orientation relative to Earth, causing the signal strength to vary periodically - almost like a cosmic lighthouse effect.

This is why satellite operators and ham radio enthusiasts tracking satellites need to be aware of the satellite's rotational characteristics. Some advanced tracking software even takes spin fading into account when predicting signal strength.

> **Key Information:** *Satellite tracking programs provide maps showing the real-time position of satellites, pass timing information, and the apparent frequency including Doppler shift effects.* These programs use Keplerian elements as inputs to calculate satellite positions.

#### Getting Started with Satellite Operation

Here's what you need to know to get started:

1. **Frequencies**: Most ham satellites operate on VHF and UHF bands, right in your Technician wheelhouse. You'll often use one band for uplink and another for downlink.

2. **Doppler Shift**: *Doppler shift in satellite communications is an observed change in signal frequency caused by relative motion between the satellite and Earth station.* As the satellite approaches, the frequency appears higher, and as it moves away, it seems lower - just like the changing pitch of a passing train's whistle.

3. **Tracking**: Satellites move fast! You'll need tracking programs to know when they're passing overhead. *These programs use Keplerian elements as inputs* - a set of numbers that describe the satellite's orbit. They're like a cosmic recipe for predicting where a satellite will be at any given time.
   
4. **Antennas**: While you can make some contacts with a handheld and its stock antenna, directional antennas work much better for satellite communications.

5. **Power**: Unlike terrestrial repeaters, you don't need much power. In fact, *using excessive uplink power can block access to the satellite by other users.* A good way to determine if your uplink power is appropriate is if *your signal strength on the downlink should be about the same as the beacon.*

> **Key Information:** *Using too much power on a satellite uplink can block access by other users* - always use just enough power to make contact.

#### Types of Satellite Operations

Amateur satellites support various types of operations:

- **FM Satellites**: Great for beginners. They work just like a repeater in the sky.
- **Linear Transponder Satellites**: These receive a range of frequencies in one band and retransmit them in another band.
- **International Space Station (ISS)**: *Any amateur holding a Technician class or higher license may contact the ISS on VHF bands* when it passes overhead.

*Amateur radio satellites commonly use multiple transmission modes including SSB, FM, CW, and data.* This variety gives operators flexibility in how they communicate through satellites.

#### Important Points to Remember

For the exam and operation, remember:

- *When a satellite is operating in "U/V mode," the satellite uplink is in the 70 centimeter band and the downlink is in the 2 meter band.*
- *Satellite tracking programs provide maps showing real-time positions, pass timing, and frequency information including Doppler shift effects.*
- *A satellite beacon is a transmission from a satellite that contains status information* about the satellite's systems.
- *Using excessive power on satellite uplinks can block access by other users.*
- *Spin fading is caused by rotation of the satellite and its antennas.*

Satellite operation might seem daunting, but it's incredibly rewarding. Start by listening to familiarize yourself with satellite passes before transmitting. Use tracking software to plan your operations, and always be mindful of your power levels.

Remember, every time you make a satellite contact, you're participating in a grand space adventure - using technology orbiting Earth at thousands of miles per hour to chat with fellow hams. Now that's taking your radio hobby to new heights!
