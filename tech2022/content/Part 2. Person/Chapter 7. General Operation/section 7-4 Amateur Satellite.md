### Section 7.4: Amateur Satellite Operation

Alright, space cadets, strap in for a journey to the final frontier of ham radio - satellite operation! Yes, you heard that right. As a Technician, you can communicate through satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth, extending your radio's reach beyond the horizon and potentially around the globe. How cool is that?

> **Key Information:** 
> * *According to FCC Part 97, a space station is an amateur station located more than 50 km above Earth's surface.* {{< link id="T1A07" >}} 
> * *Any amateur holding a Technician class or higher license can communicate through amateur satellites.* {{< link id="T1E02" >}} 
> * *Any amateur holding a Technician class or higher license may contact the ISS on VHF bands* {{< link id="T1B02" >}} when it passes overhead.

#### What are Amateur Satellites?

Amateur satellites, often called "OSCAR" (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio), are like space-based repeaters. They receive signals on one frequency (uplink) and retransmit them on another (downlink). It's like playing cosmic ping-pong with your radio waves!

> **Key Information:**
> * *A LEO satellite is a satellite in low earth orbit*, {{< link id="T8B10" >}} typically between 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth.
> * *When a satellite is operating in "U/V mode," the satellite uplink is in the 70 centimeter band (UHF) and the downlink is in the 2 meter band (VHF).* {{< link id="T8B08" >}}
> * *Amateur radio satellites commonly use multiple transmission modes including SSB, FM, CW, and data.* {{< link id="T8B04" >}}

These space speedsters zip around Earth and pass overhead several times a day. Each pass only lasts 5 to 15 minutes, so you've got to be quick! Most amateur satellites, including the popular FM ones, are LEOs.

#### Satellite Beacons and Telemetry

> **Key Information:**
> * *A satellite beacon is a transmission from a satellite that contains status information about the health and status of the satellite.* {{< link id="T8B01" >}} {{< link id="T8B05" >}}
> * *Anyone may receive telemetry from a space station* {{< link id="T8B11" >}} - these transmissions aren't encrypted and are meant to be monitored by amateur operators worldwide.

Satellite beacons are special transmissions that satellites send out regularly, like a space-based lighthouse. These beacons typically transmit telemetry data that can include battery voltage levels, temperature readings, operating mode, and spacecraft orientation.

#### Satellite Signal Characteristics

> **Key Information:**
> * *Spin fading of satellite signals is caused by rotation of the satellite and its antennas.* {{< link id="T8B09" >}}
> * *Doppler shift in satellite communications is an observed change in signal frequency caused by relative motion between the satellite and Earth station.* {{< link id="T8B07" >}}

As a satellite rotates in space, its antennas change orientation relative to Earth, causing the signal strength to vary periodically - almost like a cosmic lighthouse effect. This is why satellite operators need to be aware of the satellite's rotational characteristics.

With Doppler shift, as the satellite approaches, the frequency appears higher, and as it moves away, it seems lower - just like the changing pitch of a passing train's whistle.

#### Tracking and Operating Satellites

> **Key Information:**
> * *Satellite tracking programs provide maps showing the real-time position of satellites, pass timing information, and the apparent frequency including Doppler shift effects.* {{< link id="T8B03" >}}
> * *These programs use Keplerian elements as inputs* {{< link id="T8B06" >}} - a set of numbers that describe the satellite's orbit.
> * *Using excessive uplink power can block access to the satellite by other users.* {{< link id="T8B02" >}}
> * *Your signal strength on the downlink should be about the same as the beacon* {{< link id="T8B12" >}} to ensure your uplink power is appropriate.

Here's what you need to know to get started:

1. **Frequencies**: Most ham satellites operate on VHF and UHF bands, right in your Technician wheelhouse. You'll often use one band for uplink and another for downlink.

2. **Tracking**: Satellites move fast! You'll need tracking programs to know when they're passing overhead. They're like a cosmic recipe for predicting where a satellite will be at any given time.
   
3. **Antennas**: While you can make some contacts with a handheld and its stock antenna, directional antennas work much better for satellite communications.

4. **Power**: Unlike terrestrial repeaters, you don't need much power. Always use just enough power to make contact.

#### Types of Satellite Operations

Amateur satellites support various types of operations:

- **FM Satellites**: Great for beginners. They work just like a repeater in the sky.
- **Linear Transponder Satellites**: These receive a range of frequencies in one band and retransmit them in another band.
- **International Space Station (ISS)**: The ISS often has amateur radio equipment onboard, allowing astronauts to make contacts with Earth-bound hams.

Satellite operation might seem daunting, but it's incredibly rewarding. Start by listening to familiarize yourself with satellite passes before transmitting. Use tracking software to plan your operations, and always be mindful of your power levels.

Remember, every time you make a satellite contact, you're participating in a grand space adventure - using technology orbiting Earth at thousands of miles per hour to chat with fellow hams. Now that's taking your radio hobby to new heights!
