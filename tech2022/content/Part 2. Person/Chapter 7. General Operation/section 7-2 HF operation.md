### Section 7.2: HF Operation

Alright, new Technicians, let's take a peek into the world of HF (High Frequency) operation. Now, I know what you're thinking: "But I'm a Technician, I don't have many HF privileges!" True, but you do have some, and understanding HF operation is still useful both for the license exam and for possible future operations if you upgrade your license!

#### Technician HF Privileges

As a Technician, you have voice privileges on a small slice of the 10-meter band (28.3 to 28.5 MHz), which allows for long-distance communication through skywave propagation when conditions are right. Think of this as your foot in the door to HF—it’s a whole different world compared to VHF/UHF!

But wait, there's more! If you're feeling adventurous, as a Technician, you can also use up to 200 watts for *CW* (Morse code) on the 15, 40, and 80-meter bands. So, while your voice privileges are limited, you still have plenty of opportunities to explore HF!

#### What Makes HF Special

Here's what makes HF special:
1. **Long-Distance Communication**: As we discussed in Section 3.4, HF waves can reflect off the ionosphere, letting you talk around the world. It's like skipping stones on a pond, but with radio waves!

2. **Varying Conditions**: HF propagation changes with the time of day, season, and solar activity. One day you might chat with someone in Australia, the next day you might struggle to reach the next state.

3. **Different Modes**: While you're mostly limited to voice as a Technician, you'll hear all sorts of modes on HF - SSB (Single Sideband), CW (Morse Code), and various digital modes.

Though it might seem outdated to newcomers, CW remains popular on the HF bands due to its efficiency and ability to get through when voice signals can't.

#### HF Operating Tips

Now, let's talk about actually using that 10-meter privilege:

> **Key Information:** *Before calling CQ, you should always listen first and make sure that the frequency is not already in use.* {{< link id="T2A12" >}}

1. **Listen First**: Always listen before transmitting. HF bands can be crowded, and you don't want to interrupt ongoing conversations.

2. **Sideband Selection**: For voice on 10 meters and most HF bands above 10 MHz, you'll use USB (Upper Sideband). However, on HF bands below 10 MHz (like 40, 80, and 160 meters), LSB (Lower Sideband) is the convention. Remember: "Ten and up, USB; below ten, LSB." It's like choosing the right lane on a highway - using the correct sideband ensures clear communication and follows ham radio etiquette.

> **Key Information:** *When voice messages contain unusual words, the standard technique to ensure they are received correctly is to spell the words using a standard phonetic alphabet.* {{< link id="T2C03" >}}

3. **Speak Clearly**: HF can be noisy. Enunciate your words and use the standard phonetic alphabet for your callsign to ensure your transmission is received correctly.

4. **Be Patient**: HF contacts often involve more back-and-forth than VHF/UHF. Signal reports and location exchanges are common.

5. **Watch for Openings**: 10 meters can suddenly come alive when conditions are right. Keep an ear out for increased activity.

#### Calling CQ and Responding

Calling CQ (seeking a contact) and responding to CQ calls are fundamental skills in HF operation. Here's how to do it right:

**Calling CQ**:
1. Listen first to make sure the frequency is clear.
2. Transmit and ask if the frequency is in use – someone may have needed to step away for a moment causing a pause in an active QSO.
3. Announce something along the lines of "CQ CQ CQ, this is [your callsign]" (repeat 2-3 times).
4. End with "CQ and listening" or similar.

Example: "CQ CQ CQ, this is KA1ABC, Kilo Alpha One Alpha Bravo Charlie calling CQ and listening."

When operating in most HF bands you are using a small amount of bandwidth for a large stretch of frequencies, so it's often a good idea to have a slightly longer "CQ" message so you are talking long enough for someone who is scanning through the band to hear you. Make sure to indicate in some way that you're done because with SSB there is no carrier to drop out – there is no audible difference between transmitting and not talking and actually being done.

> **Key Information:** *When responding to a station calling CQ, you should transmit the other station's call sign followed by your own call sign.* {{< link id="T2A05" >}}

**Responding to a CQ**:
1. Wait for the station to finish their CQ call.
2. Respond with the calling station's callsign, followed by your own callsign.
3. Use standard phonetics for clarity.

Example: If W1XYZ calls CQ, you might respond: "W1XYZ, this is KA1ABC, Kilo Alpha One Alpha Bravo Charlie."

Remember, if the bands seem "dead" it could be because conditions are bad – but it could also be that everyone else is *also* listening for someone else to call. Don't be afraid to be the first person to make the call!

#### HF Quirks

Some HF quirks to remember:
- **Fading**: Signals can fade in and out as conditions change even over a brief time period. This is normal on HF, so don't panic if a station suddenly disappears.
- **QRM and QRN**: Ham lingo for man-made interference and natural noise. You'll hear a lot more of both on HF compared to VHF/UHF.

Even with limited HF privileges, you can start exploring this fascinating part of ham radio. Listen to the 10-meter band when you can. You might catch a "band opening" and make your first DX (long distance) contact. Who knows? You might just catch the HF bug and start studying for your General license!

Remember, HF operation is an art as much as a science. It takes patience and practice, but the thrill of making that first intercontinental contact is something you'll never forget. Happy HFing, and may the ionosphere be ever in your favor!
