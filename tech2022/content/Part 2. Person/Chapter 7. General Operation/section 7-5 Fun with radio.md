### Section 7.5: Fun with Amateur Radio

Alright, radio adventurers, buckle up! We're about to explore some of the coolest, quirkiest, and downright awesome things you can do with your ham radio license. Let's start with a few activities that you might encounter on the exam.

> **Key Information:** *Radio direction finding is used to locate sources of noise interference or jamming.* {{< link id="T8C01" >}} It involves using directional antennas and receivers to determine the location of a radio signal.

#### Fox Hunting and Direction Finding

Ever fancy yourself as a radio detective? Then you'll love fox hunting! In ham radio, a "fox" is a hidden transmitter, and your job is to find it using your radio skills and some clever equipment. It's like a high-tech game of hide-and-seek. Here's how it works:

1. Someone sets up a low-power transmitter (the "fox") in a secret location.
2. *Hunters use directional antennas to track down the signal.*
3. The first person or team to find the transmitter wins!

Fox hunting helps you develop valuable skills like understanding radio wave propagation, emergency communications practice, and hands-on experience with directional antennas. To get started, you just need a handheld radio, *a directional antenna (like a Yagi)* {{< link id="T8C02" >}}, and an attenuator. Many clubs organize regular fox hunts, making it a great way to meet other hams and have some outdoor radio fun.

While this is often done as a fun activity, it's also a useful skill to help locate sources of noise or jamming! Fun story – there was a time when for a few weeks a bunch of the wireless garage doors in the neighborhood weren't working. After some discussions, we noticed there was a signal on the frequencies they used which seemed to be interfering, so several of us got out our direction finding gear to track it down.

You can imagine my chagrin when we tracked the signal to a repeater in my garage! It turned out there was a loose connection which was allowing some signals from the repeater and from a broadcast station to mix together and produce the problematic signal.

#### Contesting

Ever felt the thrill of a race? Well, ham radio has its own version of high-speed competition - Contesting! *It's an operating activity that involves contacting as many stations as possible during a specified period.* {{< link id="T8C03" >}} Here's the scoop:

1. What's a contest? It's an event where hams compete to make the most contacts, often with specific goals like working different countries, states, or grid squares. Some last a few hours, others a full weekend. It's like a global radio party!

2. How does it work? You'll exchange brief info with each station you contact - usually a signal report and some other data like your location or a serial number. *When contacting another station in a contest, good procedure is to send only the minimum information needed for proper identification and the contest exchange.* {{< link id="T8C04" >}} It's not the time for a lengthy chat.

3. Why contest? It's a great way to improve your operating skills, test your station's performance, and maybe snag some rare locations for awards. Plus, the adrenaline rush is real!

4. Get on the air! Many contests have sections for newcomers or low-power stations. It's a perfect way to dip your toes into the contesting waters.

> **Key Information:** Contesting is a popular operating activity where operators try to contact as many stations as possible during a specified time period. Good contest procedure is to send only the minimum required information.

#### Grid locators

Now, let's talk about a cool tool used in many contests: grid locators. *A grid locator is a letter-number designator assigned to a geographic location* {{< link id="T8C05" >}} on Earth. For example, 'FM18' covers the Washington D.C. area. In contests, you might exchange grid squares instead of states or countries. It's like a global game of battleship! Grid locators aren't just for contests - they're useful for satellite operations, VHF/UHF work, and even general ragchewing when you want to share your location.

Here are some examples:

| Landmark | Address | City, State, ZIP | Grid Locator |
|----------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Statue of Liberty | Liberty Island | New York, NY 10004 | FN20xq |
| Golden Gate Bridge | Golden Gate Bridge | San Francisco, CA 94129 | CM87ts |
| White House | 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW | Washington, D.C. 20500 | FM18lv |
| Space Needle | 400 Broad St | Seattle, WA 98109 | CN87to |
| Graceland | 3764 Elvis Presley Blvd | Memphis, TN 38116 | EM45xb |

These examples show how grid locators can pinpoint locations across the United States. Notice how the first two characters (like FM, CM, etc.) give a rough idea of the region, while the following characters narrow down the specific location. This system allows hams to quickly communicate their approximate location without needing to exchange detailed coordinates.

#### Beyond the Exam: More Ham Radio Adventures

Now that we've covered the operating activities you need to know for the exam, let's explore some other exciting aspects of ham radio. While these topics won't be on your Technician test, they represent the incredible diversity of this hobby and might inspire your next radio adventure!

#### Ham Radio Mesh Networks

Imagine creating your own mini-internet using radio waves. That's what mesh networking is all about. Hams are setting up networks of nodes that can pass data between them, creating a robust, decentralized communication system. It's a wide area wireless network that doesn't go down when your ISP does!

#### APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) {#aprs-section75}

We talked about this a bit in Section 3.6 – think of APRS as social media for your radio! It lets you transmit your position, weather data, and short messages over ham radio. Imagine a real-time map showing where hams are operating, complete with status updates and local information. It's especially useful during public service events or emergencies, allowing coordinators to see where their operators are at a glance.

#### SOTA (Summits On The Air) and POTA (Parks On The Air)

How about combining radio with the great outdoors? These activities challenge you to make contacts from mountaintops or state/national parks. It's a perfect blend of hiking and radio. Nothing beats the thrill of making a contact from a remote peak using a radio and antenna you carried up yourself!

#### Software-Defined Radio (SDR)

For the tech-savvy hams, SDR turns your computer into a powerful radio receiver (and sometimes transmitter). With SDR, you can decode digital signals, track aircraft, listen to satellites, and even receive images from weather satellites. It's like having a super-radio that can do almost anything!

#### EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) Communications

Love space? Try EME, also known as moonbounce. Yes, you can literally bounce radio signals off the moon to communicate with other hams. It's challenging and requires some serious equipment, but how cool is it to use the moon as a giant radio reflector?

#### DIY Projects

For the builders and tinkerers, there's a whole world of DIY projects. From constructing your own antennas to building QRP (low power) transceivers, the possibilities are endless. It's like adult LEGO, but with the satisfaction of making contacts on gear you built yourself!

#### Digital Modes

While not exactly new, modes like FT8 are revolutionizing how we make contacts. Using these modes, you can communicate around the world with very low power and compromised antennas. It's like having a superpower that lets you whisper across continents!

#### So much more!

Remember, these are just a few examples of the amazing things you can do with ham radio. The hobby is constantly evolving, with hams finding new and innovative ways to use radio technology. Whether you're into high-tech experimentation or good old-fashioned conversation, there's always something new to try.

So don't be afraid to explore, experiment, and push the boundaries of what's possible with your license. Who knows? You might just pioneer the next big thing in ham radio. Now get out there and make some radio magic happen!
