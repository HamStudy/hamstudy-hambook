### Section 5.1: AC Power

#### What is AC Power?

First things first: AC stands for Alternating Current. Unlike the DC (Direct Current) that powers most of our radios, AC constantly changes direction. In the United States, it does this 60 times per second. That's why we say our power is 60 Hz.

#### Why Does AC Power Matter for Hams?

Why should you care about AC power as a ham? Well, unless you're running everything off batteries (and kudos if you are!), AC is what's powering your station. It's also potentially dangerous if not respected.

#### The Basics of AC Power

Let’s break down the basics:

- **Voltage**: In the U.S., most home outlets provide 120 volts AC. That's enough to give you a nasty shock or worse. Some appliances, like electric dryers or stoves, use 240 volts.
  
- **Current**: This is measured in amperes or amps. Your typical household circuit might be 15 or 20 amps.

- **Grounding**: This is super important. The third prong on your plugs? That's the ground. It's there to protect you if something goes wrong inside the equipment.

#### AC Power Safety Tips

Now, let's talk safety:

- **Keep It Dry**: Water and electricity don't mix. Keep your equipment dry, and never operate with wet hands.

- **Unplug Before Working**: If you're going to work on equipment, unplug it first. And even then, be careful—some devices (like old tube amplifiers) can store charge in capacitors long after they're unplugged.

- **Grounding Matters**: Use properly grounded outlets and equipment. That third prong isn't just for show!

- **Check Your Cords**: Be cautious of frayed cords or damaged plugs. They're accidents waiting to happen.

- **Don't Overload Circuits**: Know how much current your equipment draws and make sure your wiring can handle it.

- **Ask for Help**: If you're not sure, ask for help. There's no shame in calling an electrician or a more experienced ham for advice.

#### A Word on Generators

Oh, and one more thing: if you're thinking of running a generator for field day or emergency operations, make sure you know how to use it safely. Never run a generator indoors or in an enclosed space—the carbon monoxide can be deadly.

Stay safe out there, and happy hamming!
