### Section 5.1: AC Power

#### What is AC Power?

First things first: AC stands for Alternating Current. Unlike the DC (Direct Current) that powers most of our radios, AC constantly changes direction. In the United States, it does this 60 times per second. That's why we say our power is 60 Hz.

#### Why Does AC Power Matter for Hams?

Why should you care about AC power as a ham? Well, unless you're running everything off batteries (and kudos if you are!), AC is what's powering your station. It's also potentially dangerous if not respected.

#### The Basics of AC Power

Let's break down the basics:

- **Voltage**: In the U.S., most home outlets provide 120 volts AC. That's enough to give you a nasty shock or worse. Some appliances, like electric dryers or stoves, use 240 volts.
  
- **Current**: This is measured in amperes or amps. Your typical household circuit might be 15 or 20 amps.


- **Wiring Colors**: Understanding wire colors in AC wiring is important for safety. That said, never assume a wire is safe to touch just based on its color – always test with proper equipment!

  > **Key Information:** *In the United States, black wire insulation indicates the "hot" wire, white is neutral, and green or bare copper is the ground* {{< link id="T0A03" >}}

- **Grounding**: This is super important. The third prong on your plugs? That's the ground. It's there to protect you by providing a safe path for current if something goes wrong inside the equipment.

#### Electrical Hazards to the Human Body

> **Key Information:** *Electrical current through the body can cause tissue heating, disrupt cellular electrical function, and cause involuntary muscle contractions* {{< link id="T0A02" >}}

Electrical current flowing through the body is dangerous in several ways:

- *It can cause heating of tissue*, similar to how a heating element works but inside your body. This can cause burns, both external and internal.

- *It can disrupt the normal electrical functions of cells*, especially in the heart and nervous system. Even relatively small currents can interfere with your heart's rhythm.

- *It can cause involuntary muscle contractions* that might prevent you from letting go of an energized conductor, leading to prolonged exposure.

Any one of these effects can be serious or fatal depending on the current path through your body, duration of contact, and the amount of current.

#### AC Power Safety Tips

> **Key Information:** *Always use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC-powered equipment, connect to a common safety ground, and install mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits* {{< link id="T0A06" >}}

To guard against electrical shock at your station:

- *Use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC-powered equipment*. The third wire (green/bare) provides an alternate path for current if insulation fails.

- *Connect all AC-powered station equipment to a common safety ground*. This helps prevent voltage differences between equipment that could create shock hazards.

- *Install mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits* to prevent accidental contact with dangerous voltages.

- **Keep It Dry**: Water and electricity don't mix. Keep your equipment dry, and never operate with wet hands.

- **Unplug Before Working**: If you're going to work on equipment, unplug it first. And even then, be careful—some devices (like old tube amplifiers) can store charge in capacitors long after they're unplugged.

- **Check Your Cords**: Be cautious of frayed cords or damaged plugs. They're accidents waiting to happen.

- **Don't Overload Circuits**: Know how much current your equipment draws and make sure your wiring can handle it.

- **Ask for Help**: If you're not sure, ask for help. There's no shame in calling an electrician or a more experienced ham for advice.

Stay safe out there, and happy hamming!
