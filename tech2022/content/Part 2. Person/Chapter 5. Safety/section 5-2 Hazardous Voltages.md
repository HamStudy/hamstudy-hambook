### Section 5.2: Hazardous Voltages

#### What Are Hazardous Voltages?

In the ham radio world, we generally consider anything above 30 volts to be potentially hazardous. That might seem low, but remember, it doesn't take much to give you a nasty shock or worse.

#### Where Might You Encounter Hazardous Voltages?

You might be surprised where hazardous voltages can pop up:

- **Power Supplies**: That 13.8V power supply for your radio? Inside, it's converting 120V AC to DC. One wrong move and you could be in for a shock.

- **Antenna Systems**: Ever heard of "hot" antennas? Some antennas can develop high voltages at their feed points, especially when transmitting.

- **Older Equipment**: If you're lucky enough to play with some vintage gear, be extra cautious. Old tube equipment can have voltages in the hundreds or even thousands of volts!

- **Capacitors**: These little storage tanks can hold a charge long after equipment is unplugged. They're like electrical grudge-holders.

Here’s a story to keep in mind: A ham I know was working on an old receiver. He’d unplugged it but didn’t discharge the capacitors. One zap later, and he had a newfound respect for those innocuous-looking components!

#### Staying Safe Around Hazardous Voltages

So, how do we stay safe?

- **Assume Everything is "Hot"**: Always assume equipment is live until proven otherwise. Use a voltmeter to check before you touch.

- **One Hand Rule**: Use one hand when working around high voltages. It sounds weird, but it keeps current from flowing across your chest if you do get shocked.

- **Discharge Capacitors Properly**: Capacitors can hold a dangerous charge. Learn safe ways to discharge them before you need to.

- **Keep Your Workspace Dry**: Water and electricity don’t mix. Use insulated tools and make sure your work area is dry.

- **Never Work Alone**: When working on high-voltage equipment, always have a buddy around who knows CPR, just in case.

- **If You're Not Sure, Don’t Touch It**: There’s no shame in asking for help or leaving it to the experts.

Remember, the goal is to make contacts, not become one with your equipment. Electricity doesn’t care how experienced you are or how careful you think you’re being. It’ll take any path to ground, including through you if you give it the chance.

#### Final Thoughts

But don’t let this scare you away from the hobby! With proper respect and precautions, you can safely enjoy all aspects of ham radio. Just remember: when in doubt, hands out!

Stay safe, and keep those electrons where they belong—in your radio, not through your body!
