### Section 6.4: Operating Controls for All-Mode Transceivers

> **Note to New Technicians:** While most of your initial operating will likely be on FM with VHF/UHF equipment, understanding the basics of all-mode transceivers will prepare you for future growth in the hobby. This section covers the essential controls you'll encounter as you expand your interest towards the next license class.

All-mode transceivers add significant capabilities beyond FM-only radios, allowing you to operate SSB (Single Sideband), CW (Morse Code), and digital modes. Let's focus on the most important additional controls you'll need to understand.

#### Mode Selection

The fundamental difference with an all-mode transceiver is the ability to select different operating modes through a control typically labeled "MODE":

- **SSB** (USB - Upper Sideband and LSB - Lower Sideband)
- **CW** (Continuous Wave for Morse code)
- **AM** (Amplitude Modulation)
- **FM** (Frequency Modulation)
- **Digital** (Sometimes labeled DATA or RTTY)

For VHF/UHF SSB operation, *Upper Sideband (USB) is normally used*.

#### Microphone Gain

> **Key Information:** *Excessive microphone gain on SSB transmissions causes distorted transmitted audio*.

Unlike FM, where your microphone gain rarely needs adjustment, proper mic gain setting is critical for SSB:
- Too high: Distorted audio that's difficult to understand
- Too low: Weak signal that others will struggle to hear

Start with a moderate setting and get on-air reports to adjust it properly. Clear, undistorted audio is the goal.

#### Receiver Bandwidth Controls

> **Key Information:** *Having multiple receive bandwidth choices on a multimode transceiver permits noise or interference reduction by selecting a bandwidth matching the mode*. For SSB reception, *a 2400 Hz filter bandwidth provides the best signal-to-noise ratio*.

All-mode transceivers let you adjust how "wide" a slice of the radio spectrum your receiver processes:

- **SSB**: Typically 2400 Hz (best signal-to-noise ratio)
- **CW**: Typically 250-500 Hz
- **AM**: Typically 6 kHz
- **FM**: Typically 10-15 kHz
- **Digital**: Varies by mode

Narrower bandwidths reduce noise and interference but might affect audio quality. Wider bandwidths provide better fidelity but let in more noise.

#### RIT/Clarifier

> **Key Information:** *The RIT or Clarifier control can be used if the voice pitch of a single-sideband signal seems too high or low*.

When operating SSB, you might notice that some stations sound too high-pitched or too low-pitched. The RIT (Receiver Incremental Tuning) control—sometimes called a Clarifier—allows you to adjust only your receive frequency without changing your transmit frequency, making the voice sound more natural.

#### Electronic Keyers for CW

> **Key Information:** An *electronic keyer assists in manual sending of Morse code*.

If you're interested in Morse code, all-mode transceivers typically include an electronic keyer for use with a paddle-type Morse key. This feature helps generate properly timed dots and dashes, making your CW transmissions cleaner and more consistent.

#### Speech Processor/Compressor

Many all-mode transceivers include a speech processor that boosts the average power of your voice transmissions. Use it sparingly—just enough to enhance your signal without causing distortion.

#### Noise Reduction Features

All-mode transceivers often include noise reduction systems:

- **Noise Blanker**: Helps reduce impulse noise like ignition noise
- **Digital Noise Reduction**: Uses DSP to identify and reduce random noise
- **Notch Filter**: Eliminates steady tones that can make reception difficult

#### Digital Mode Operation

When operating digital modes (like FT8, PSK31, or RTTY):
1. Select USB or a dedicated DATA mode
2. Reduce power (30-50% of maximum) to prevent overheating
3. Turn OFF speech processors
4. Select appropriate filters for the digital mode

#### Learning Curve

All-mode transceivers have a steeper learning curve than FM-only radios, but don't be intimidated. Start with the basic controls you learned for FM operation, then gradually explore these additional features as your interests expand beyond local repeater operation.

Remember that these advanced capabilities are what will eventually allow you to communicate across the country and around the world as you upgrade your license and gain access to more HF privileges!
