### Section 6.3: Operating Controls for FM Transceivers

Let's explore the essential controls you'll use on FM transceivers—the radio type most new Technicians start with for VHF/UHF operation. Whether you're using a handheld (HT) or a mobile rig, these controls will get you on the air quickly.

#### Basic Controls

> **Key Information:** Modern transceivers offer multiple ways to enter an operating frequency, including *using the keypad or VFO (tuning) knob*.

Every FM transceiver has these fundamental controls:

- **Power/Volume**: Turns the radio on/off and adjusts audio level
- **Frequency Entry**: Set your operating frequency using:
  - **Direct Entry**: Use the keypad to type in the exact frequency
  - **VFO Knob**: Turn to tune up or down the band
- **PTT (Push-To-Talk)**: This button *switches the transceiver from receive to transmit when grounded*

#### Memory Channels

> **Key Information:** *Memory channels enable quick access to favorite frequencies*.

Rather than entering frequencies manually each time, store them in your radio's memory:
- Program your frequently used channels (repeaters, simplex frequencies)
- Then simply select from these saved channels using up/down buttons
- Most radios store dozens or even hundreds of channels, each with its associated settings

#### Squelch Control

> **Key Information:** The squelch function *mutes the receiver audio when a signal is not present*.

The squelch control sets a threshold—signals below this level are muted:
- Too low: Constant background noise
- Too high: Might miss weak signals
- Just right: Silent until someone transmits

*To hear weak FM signals, adjust the squelch threshold so that receiver output audio is on all the time*, then slowly increase until background noise just disappears.

#### Scanning Function

> **Key Information:** The scanning function *tunes through a range of frequencies to check for activity*.

This feature automatically searches for active channels:
- When the radio detects a signal, it pauses so you can listen
- Once the transmission ends, scanning resumes
- This is useful for finding active repeaters or monitoring multiple channels

#### Tone Controls

> **Key Information:** *CTCSS uses a sub-audible tone transmitted along with normal voice audio to open the squelch of a receiver*.

Many repeaters require specific tones for access:

- **CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System)**: Sub-audible tones sent along with your voice
- **DCS (Digital-Coded Squelch)**: Digital alternative to CTCSS

> **Key Information:** *DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) uses pairs of audio tones* for sending commands.

- **DTMF**: The same technology as touch-tone phones, used to control repeater functions or access internet-linked systems

#### Repeater-Specific Controls

> **Key Information:** The VHF/UHF reverse function *lets you listen on a repeater's input frequency*.

When working through repeaters, you'll use:

- **Offset**: Sets the difference between transmit and receive frequencies for repeaters. *Common offsets are plus or minus 600 kHz on 2 meters and plus or minus 5 MHz on 70 cm bands*.

- **Reverse Function**: Temporarily swaps your transmit and receive frequencies to *listen on the repeater's input frequency*.

#### Power Level Selection

Most FM transceivers offer selectable power levels:
- Handhelds: Typically Low (0.5-1W) and High (5W)
- Mobile rigs: Often Low, Medium, and High (5-50W+)

Always use the minimum power necessary for reliable communication. Lower power conserves battery life in handhelds and reduces the chance of interfering with other stations.

#### Learn Your Radio

Every radio model is different, so take time to read your owner's manual. Understanding your specific radio's menu system and button functions will make operating much more enjoyable and avoid frustration when you're trying to make contacts.

Now that you're familiar with FM transceiver controls, you're ready to get on the air! As you grow in the hobby, you might eventually explore the additional capabilities of all-mode transceivers covered in the next section.
