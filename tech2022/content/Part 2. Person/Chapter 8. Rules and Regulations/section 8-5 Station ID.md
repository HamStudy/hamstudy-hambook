### Section 8.5: Station Identification

Alright, fellow hams, let's talk about one of the most fundamental rules in amateur radio: station identification. It's like signing your name, but over the airwaves!

#### When to Identify

The FCC requires you to identify your station in two key situations:
1. At least every 10 minutes during a contact
2. At the end of each communication

Remember: "Ten and End" - identify at least every ten minutes and at the end.

> **IMPORTANT!** Even if you are just doing a short test transmission you are still required to identify with your call sign!

#### How to Identify

Your station identification must include your FCC-assigned call sign. Here are some key points:

1. **Language**: You must identify in English. However, you can also add identifications in other languages if you wish.

2. **Voice Identification**: Simply state your call sign. For example: "This is KA1ABC" or "KA1ABC clear."
   * Any time you can identify with voice you can also identify with morse code (CW). That's mostly used by repeaters, but the rule is there!

3. **CW and Digital Modes**: Transmit your call sign using the mode you're operating in.

4. **Phonetics**: While not required, the FCC encourages the use of a phonetic alphabet for station identification when operating phone modes. This practice helps ensure clear and accurate communication of call signs, especially in challenging conditions. For example: "Kilo Alpha One Alpha Bravo Charlie." instead of "KA1ABC". It's best to use a standard alphabet rather than making one up so as to prevent confusion.

5. **Self-Assigned Indicators**: Want to add a little flair to your call sign? You can use self-assigned indicators! These are like radio bumper stickers that tell others something special about your operation. Add them before or after your call sign (or both!), separated by a slash (/) *or a word that means slash*. For example, "KA1ABC/MOB" or "KA1ABC/R" lets folks know you're on the move. "W1AW/70" might indicate you're celebrating a 70th anniversary. Just remember, your indicator can't clash with any FCC-specified indicators or country prefixes. It's a fun way to personalize your call while still playing by the rules!

#### Special Situations

1. **Club Stations**: Use the club's call sign, not your personal one.
2. **Special Event Stations**: Use the special event call sign if one has been issued.
3. **Remote Operation**: Additional identification rules may apply. Check current FCC regulations.

#### Using Tactical Call Signs

As much as we all love our call signs (if you don't, you will!) there are times when it's not super convenient to keep track of them when working with a group. Imagine you are helping with a large event – perhaps a parade in a mid-sized city. Let's say we need someone at each of these stations:

* Parade headquarters – someone to coordinate with the officials in charge of the parade and relay information as needed
* 1st Street
* 2nd Street
* 3rd Street
* 4th Street
* Staging – the beginning of the parade where floats prepare to start the parade
* Net Control – the person coordinating all the operators so they don't all talk over each other

Now, imagine that for some reason the parade is going to last for a long time and so you have people changing out in shifts; when you need to know what is going on at 3rd street you don't really care who the operator there is, you just need to talk to someone at that location.

Fortunately, Part 97 doesn't require that you identify the person you are calling by their real call sign! It only requires that you identify *yourself* – and thus the purpose of a tactical call sign!

**What are tactical call signs?**
Tactical call signs are short, descriptive names used to identify a station's function or location during an event. You might then have a conversation like this one:

* "1st street, this is Net Control"
* "Net control from 1st street, go ahead!"
* "Do you have eyes on the parade with the giant bologna sandwich?"
* "Affirmative net control, they are passing my location now"
* "Thank you. I'll send someone to return their cooler of pastrami – it fell off a block back and they didn't notice"
* "Copy that. 1st street, KF1AZT clear"
* "Net control, NT3ST clear"

Notice a few things in this contrived example:

* It is easy for everyone to follow who is talking and what is going on – even if they don't know where KF1AZT is. If they had used call signs instead it would have been much harder to keep track of that.
* The rules don't require that you identify yourself every transmission, just once every 10 minutes and at the end – so you need to sign off with your call sign but you can respond with the tactical call sign.
* The specifics of when and how you identify with your real call sign don't matter as long as you follow those two rules.

Remember, tactical call signs are the cherry on top of your communication sundae, not a replacement for your official FCC call sign. Use them wisely, and you'll be the communication superhero your event needs!

#### Exceptions to Identification Requirements

While station identification is generally required, there are a few specific situations where an amateur station may transmit without identifying on the air:

1. **Transmissions to control model craft**: When using radio control for telecommand you are not required to identify in the regular ways. 
   > **telecommand**: A one‐way transmission to initiate, modify, or terminate functions of a device at a 
distance.

2. **Transmissions from a space station**: Space stations operating under automatic control may have different identification requirements. There are special licensing requirements for putting up a space station. You mostly just need to know that it's on the list of exceptions!

Remember, these exceptions are limited. In most cases, proper identification is still required.

#### Tips and Tricks

1. Set a 10-minute timer during long QSOs to remind you to identify.
2. While not required, many hams choose to identify at the beginning of a contact as a courtesy. This is perfectly fine and usually a good idea, just not mandated by FCC rules.
3. Whenever you call someone on the air always say their call sign first – and possibly more than once. That's because not everyone is listening all the time, but most of us get used to listening for our call sign. We'll start listening when we notice our call sign but may not have noticed what you said before. If you identify yourself *after* the person you are calling then they are more likely to know who they should respond to.

#### Pro Tip

Practice saying your call sign clearly and confidently. It's your radio identity, wear it with pride!

#### Exam Tip

The FCC is particularly interested in making sure you know when and how to identify. Expect several questions on this topic in your Technician exam.

Remember, proper identification is not just a legal requirement; it's a courtesy to other operators. It helps everyone know who they're talking to and avoids confusion on the bands. By following these identification rules, you're not just complying with FCC regulations; you're participating in the long-standing traditions of amateur radio. So get out there, key up that mic, and let the world know who you are - every 10 minutes and at the end of your QSO!
