### Section 8.3: Authorized Frequencies

Welcome to your radio playground, new Technicians! Let's explore the frequencies you're allowed to use. As a Technician class operator, you've got a wide range of frequencies at your disposal, from HF all the way up to microwaves.

Most of this section involves memorization for the exam. Don't worry about committing every frequency to memory - focus on understanding the concepts and memorizing the specific points that appear in the test questions. For everyday operating, most hams keep reference charts handy or look up the information when they need it. Review the questions for this chapter to see what specific facts you need to know for the exam.

Now, let's break it down:

> **Key Information:** *Technician class operators have phone privileges on the 10 meter band only* (28.300-28.500 MHz) among all HF bands. On VHF/UHF bands, *SSB phone may be used in at least some segment of all amateur bands above 50 MHz*.

#### HF (High Frequency) Privileges

1. 80 meters: CW only on 3.525 - 3.600 MHz
2. 40 meters: CW only on 7.025 - 7.125 MHz
3. 15 meters: CW only on 21.025 - 21.200 MHz
4. 10 meters: 
   - CW, RTTY, and Data: 28.000 - 28.300 MHz
   - Phone (SSB) and CW: 28.300 - 28.500 MHz

> **Key Information:** *The maximum peak envelope power output for Technician class operators in their HF band segments is 200 watts*.

#### VHF (Very High Frequency)

1. 6 meters: 50 - 54 MHz
   - 50.0 - 50.1MHz: CW only
   - 50.1 - 54: All modes including voice
2. 2 meters: 144 - 148 MHz
   - 144.0 - 144.1 MHz: CW only
   - 144.1 - 148 MHz: All modes including voice
3. 1.25 meters:
   - 219 - 220 MHz: Fixed digital message forwarding only
   - 222 - 225 MHz: All modes including voice

> **Key Information:** *52.525 MHz is in the 6 meter amateur band* and *146.52 MHz is in the 2 meter amateur band*. *50.0 MHz to 50.1 MHz and 144.0 MHz to 144.1 MHz are limited to CW only*.

#### UHF (Ultra High Frequency)

1. 70 centimeters: 420 - 450 MHz

#### Microwave Bands

Various bands above 902 MHz

> **Key Information:** *The maximum peak envelope power output for Technician class operators using frequencies above 30 MHz is 1500 watts*.

Remember, "CW" (short for "Continuous Wave") refers to Morse code, "Phone" means voice transmissions, and "Data" covers digital modes.

#### Band Designations

Amateur radio bands are often referred to by their approximate wavelength rather than their frequency range. Remember from Section 3.1 that wavelength and frequency are inversely related - as frequency increases, wavelength decreases.

> **Key Information:** *Amateur radio bands are identified by their approximate wavelength in meters*. For example, *52.525 MHz is in the 6 meter amateur band* and *146.52 MHz is in the 2 meter amateur band*.

This naming convention is why you'll hear references to the "2-meter band" (144-148 MHz), the "70-centimeter band" (420-450 MHz), or the "10-meter band" (28-29.7 MHz). If you need a refresher on calculating wavelengths, refer back to Section 3.1 where we covered the wavelength formula and examples in detail.

This naming system gives us a quick way to approximate the size of antennas needed for these bands, since antenna elements are often designed as fractions (like 1/4 or 1/2) of the wavelength. It's also part of the rich tradition and language of amateur radio that connects us to generations of operators who came before us.

#### Special Note on the 1.25 Meter Band

The 1.25 meter band (220-225 MHz) has a unique allocation. *Amateurs may use the 219 to 220 MHz segment of the 1.25 meter band only for fixed digital message forwarding systems*. There's then a gap from 220-222 MHz that we aren't allowed to use (there was a time in the past when we could). The rest of the band, from 222-225 MHz, is available for general use. It's like a highway with a special lane for digital traffic and a wider lane for everything else!

#### Power Limits for Technician Class Operators

Now that we've covered where you can transmit, let's talk about how much power you can use. As a Technician, you've got some hefty power limits to work with:

1. HF Bands: On the HF bands where you have privileges (remember those 80, 40, 15, and 10 meter segments we talked about?), you're allowed a maximum peak envelope power (PEP) output of 200 watts. If that doesn't seem like a lot consider that most typical HF radios have a maximum output power of 100 watts *or less*.

2. VHF and Above: For frequencies at 50 MHz and above (that's your 6 meter, 2 meter, 70 cm bands, and beyond), you've got even more power at your disposal. The general limit is 1500 watts PEP output. To say that this is excessive for most purposes would be a tiny bit of an understatement â€“ the typical VHF/UHF radio has a max power output of 50 watts and that's usually plenty.

Now, before you get too excited about cranking up the power, remember a few things:

- Just because you can use that much power doesn't mean you always should. Good operators use the minimum power necessary to make the contact. It's like using an "indoor voice" - you don't shout when a normal conversation will do.

- Some modes or specific segments might have lower power limits. Always check the current band plan and regulations.

- With great power comes great responsibility. Higher power means more potential for interference with neighbors' electronics and more safety considerations in your shack.

- Your antenna system plays a huge role in how effective your signal is. A good antenna with lower power often outperforms a poor antenna with high power. Additionally, using too much power can damage most antennas and feedlines!

Remember, as a Technician, you're learning the ropes of ham radio. Start with lower power, learn good operating practices, and work your way up as you gain experience. It's not about how much power you can pump out - it's about how effectively you can communicate!

#### Listening Privileges

While these are your transmitting privileges, you can listen on any frequency. It's like having an all-access pass to the radio concert, but you can only sing along on certain stages!

#### Operating Near Band Edges

> **Key Information:** *You should not set your transmit frequency to be exactly at the edge of an amateur band or sub-band to allow for calibration error, modulation sidebands, and frequency drift*.

Here's a pro tip that might save you from an FCC warning: Be careful about operating right at the edge of a band or sub-band. It's like walking a tightrope over a pool of regulatory sharks - one small misstep and you could find yourself in dangerous waters. Here's why you should give yourself a little buffer:

1. Frequency Accuracy: Your radio's frequency display might not be 100% accurate. Even a small error could put you out of bounds.

2. Modulation Sidebands: When you transmit, your signal takes up more space than just the frequency you're tuned to. The sidebands of your transmission could spill over into unauthorized frequencies if you're too close to the edge.

3. Frequency Drift: Some radios, especially if they're not warmed up, might drift slightly in frequency as you operate.

For these reasons, it's good practice to stay a little bit inside the band edges when you transmit. Think of it as giving yourself a safety margin. Most experienced hams try to stay at least a few kHz inside the band, just to be on the safe side.

It's always better to err on the side of caution and keep your signals well within the authorized limits. That way, you can focus on enjoying your contacts without worrying about accidentally straying out of bounds!

Happy frequency hopping, and may your signals always find their mark!
