### Section 8.7: Control Operator and Control Types

Let’s take a closer look at control operators and control types—it’s all about who’s responsible for what goes out over the airwaves!  

#### Control Operator

A control operator is an amateur radio operator designated by the station licensee (owner of the station) to be responsible for the transmissions from that station. Here are the key points:

> **Key Information:** *The station licensee must designate the station control operator.* {{< link id="T1E03" >}}

1. The station licensee must designate at least one control operator.

2. The control operator is responsible for the proper operation of the station.

   > **Key Information:** *When the control operator is not the station licensee, both the control operator and the station licensee are responsible for the proper operation of the station.* {{< link id="T1E07" >}}

3. The privileges you can use are determined by your license class, not the station's capabilities:

   > **Key Information:** *The class of operator license held by the control operator determines the transmitting frequency privileges of an amateur station.* {{< link id="T1E04" >}}

4. **There must *always* be a control operator**.  

   > **Key Information:** *An amateur station may never transmit without a control operator.* {{< link id="T1E01" >}}
   
   Even in the case of automatic control such as a repeater where no control operator is present, there must still be a control operator designated (usually the repeater owner or trustee).

5. Keep your station records organized and complete:

   > **Key Information:** *The station and its records must be available for FCC inspection at any time upon request by an FCC representative.* {{< link id="T1F01" >}}

6. Unless you have documentation specifying otherwise, the FCC assumes you're in charge of your station:

   > **Key Information:** *The FCC presumes the station licensee to be the control operator of an amateur station, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station records.* {{< link id="T1E11" >}}

Remember: "the buck stops here!" The control operator is responsible for ensuring all transmissions comply with FCC rules.

When operating on different frequency bands, there are important limitations to consider:

> **Key Information:** *A Technician class licensee may never be the control operator of a station operating in an Amateur Extra Class band segment.* {{< link id="T1E06" >}}

What about responsibility when using a repeater? Here's an important point:

> **Key Information:** *The control operator of the originating station is accountable if a repeater inadvertently retransmits communications that violate the FCC rules.* {{< link id="T1F10" >}}

If a repeater inadvertently retransmits something which violates the FCC rules, the control operator of the station which sent the original transmission is accountable, not the repeater operator.

#### Types of Control

There are three types of control in amateur radio:

##### 1. Local Control

> **Key Information:** *The control point of an amateur station is the location at which the control operator function is performed.* {{< link id="T1E05" >}}

- The control point is at the same physical location as the station itself.
- This is the most common type for home stations and portable operations.
- Example: You're sitting at your home station, operating your radio.

##### 2. Remote Control

Remote control operation is like being a radio wizard - you can control your station from afar! But with great power comes great responsibility.

> **Key Information:** *Operating the station over the internet is an example of remote control as defined in Part 97.* {{< link id="T1E10" >}}

- The control operator is not at the station location but can still control the transmitter.
- Often uses internet or dedicated control links.
- Example: Operating your home station from your smartphone while you're at work.

For remote control, the FCC requires specific conditions:

> **Key Information:** *The control operator must be at the control point, a control operator is required at all times, and the control operator must indirectly manipulate the controls.* {{< link id="T1E09" >}}

##### 3. Automatic Control

> **Key Information:** *Repeater operation is an example of automatic control.* {{< link id="T1E08" >}}

- The station operates without a control operator present.
- Limited to specific operations like repeaters, beacons, and space stations.
- Example: A repeater that operates 24/7 without someone constantly monitoring it.

#### Automatic Retransmission

> **Key Information:** *Repeater, auxiliary, or space stations are the types of amateur stations that can automatically retransmit the signals of other amateur stations.* {{< link id="T1D07" >}}

Some types of amateur stations are permitted to automatically retransmit signals from other stations. This is a key aspect of automatic control that has specific rules:

1. Repeater Stations: These receive signals on one frequency and simultaneously retransmit them on another, extending the range of communications.

2. Auxiliary Stations: These can automatically retransmit signals as part of a local network of amateur stations. Part 97 defines an Auxiliary station as:
   > An amateur station, other than in a message forwarding system, that is transmitting communications point-to-point within a system of cooperating amateur stations.

3. Space Stations: Satellites and other space-based amateur radio stations can automatically retransmit signals from Earth stations.

#### Key Points to Control Operators

1. The control operator is responsible for all transmissions from the station, regardless of who is actually speaking.
2. If the station licensee and the control operator are not the same individual, both equally share responsibility for proper operation of the station. It's like loaning out your car – careful who you give the keys to, because if there is an accident you both end up paying!
3. If a station is operating under automatic control, it must cease operation if it causes harmful interference.
4. For remote and automatic control, the licensee must be able to deactivate the transmitter from a distance if necessary.

If you're operating someone else's station, make sure you know what privileges you're allowed to use. You can only operate within the limits of your license class, even if the station is capable of more.

Understanding control operators and control types is crucial for responsible amateur radio operation. It ensures that someone is always accountable for what's being transmitted, helping to maintain the integrity of our bands. So whether you're at the helm of your own station or operating remotely, remember - you're the captain of your radio ship!
