## Chapter 2: Electrical Components

Every radio is made up of basic building blocks - electrical components that work together to make communication possible. In this chapter, we'll introduce you to these components and help you understand their roles in amateur radio equipment.

You don't need to be an electrical engineer to understand this stuff! We'll keep things simple and practical, focusing on what these components do rather than complex theory. It's just like getting to know the different tools in a toolbox - you don't need to know how to build them, just what they're used for.

We'll look at:
- Basic parts like resistors and capacitors
- How components appear in circuit diagrams
- What different components do in radio equipment

The goal isn't to make you an electronics expert - it's to help you understand what's happening inside your radio equipment and to prepare you for your license exam. By the end of this chapter, you'll be familiar enough with these components to understand basic radio concepts and troubleshooting.

Let's get started with these building blocks of amateur radio!
