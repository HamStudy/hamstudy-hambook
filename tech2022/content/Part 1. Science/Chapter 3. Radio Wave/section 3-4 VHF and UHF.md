### Section 3.4: VHF and UHF Waves

As a Technician class operator, you'll probably spend much of your time on the VHF and UHF bands. These are the heart of local communications and are perfect for getting started in amateur radio.

#### Frequency Ranges and Characteristics

VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) cover:
- VHF: 30 MHz to 300 MHz
- UHF: 300 MHz to 3 GHz

The most popular Technician class bands are:
- 2 meters (144-148 MHz) - VHF
- 70 centimeters (420-450 MHz) - UHF

**Key Information**: *UHF signals are rarely heard beyond their radio horizon because they are not usually propagated by the ionosphere*. Unlike HF signals that can bounce off the ionosphere to travel long distances, VHF and UHF signals generally travel in straight lines, making them reliable for local communications but limiting their range.

> Reminder: want to know the wavelength of a frequency in meters? Just divide 300 by the frequency in MHz. So for 146 MHz ($\frac{300}{146}), you get about 2 meters.

#### Operating Modes

**Key Information**: 
- *Simplex* means *transmitting and receiving on the same frequency*
- The *national calling frequency for FM simplex operations in the 2 meter band is **146.520 MHz***

VHF/UHF operation typically uses two main methods:

1. **Simplex Operation**:
   - Direct station-to-station communication
   - Both stations use the same frequency
   - Great for learning basic radio skills
   - Use 146.520 MHz when looking for 2-meter FM contacts

2. **Repeater Operation**:
   - Uses a repeater station to extend range
   - Transmit and receive on different frequencies (offset)
   - May require CTCSS tones for access
   - Excellent for reliable local coverage

#### Practical Advantages

VHF and UHF bands offer several benefits:
1. **Compact Antennas**: Higher frequencies mean shorter wavelengths, allowing for smaller, more manageable antennas
2. **Reliable Local Communications**: Less affected by ionospheric conditions than HF
3. **Extensive Repeater Networks**: Many repeaters operate on these bands
4. **Equipment Availability**: Wide variety of affordable radios and antennas

#### Band Plans and Frequencies

Important frequencies to remember:
- 146.52 MHz: National FM simplex calling frequency on 2 meters
- 446.00 MHz: National FM simplex calling frequency on 70 cm

Always check your local band plan, as frequency usage can vary by region.

#### Practical Applications

These bands are perfect for:
1. **Local Communication**: Chatting with nearby hams or participating in local nets
2. **Emergency Communications**: ARES and RACES often use these bands
3. **Public Service Events**: Supporting marathons, parades, and other community events
4. **Satellite Operations**: Many amateur satellites use VHF/UHF frequencies

#### Getting Started on VHF/UHF

1. **Equipment**: Most new hams start with a VHF/UHF handheld transceiver (HT) or mobile rig

2. **Antenna Considerations**: 
   - Height matters more than power
   - Most FM antennas are vertically polarized
   - Indoor or outdoor antennas both work well

3. **Operating Tips**:
   - Start by listening to learn local patterns
   - Join local nets to practice and meet others
   - Try both simplex and repeater operations
   - Experiment with different antennas

Remember that VHF and UHF bands offer a perfect entry point into amateur radio. While they don't usually provide the long-distance capabilities of HF, they give you reliable local communications and plenty of opportunities to develop your operating skills.

As you gain experience, you might explore:
- Weak signal work using SSB
- Satellite communications
- Digital modes and Internet Gateways
- Public service communications

These bands will likely remain a core part of your amateur radio activities even as you explore other aspects of the hobby. We'll talk more about the practical applications in the second half of this book!
