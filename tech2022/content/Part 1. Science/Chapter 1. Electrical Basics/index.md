## Chapter 1: Electrical Principles

Welcome to the foundation of amateur radio - electrical principles! In this chapter, we'll dive into the fascinating world of electricity that powers all our radio adventures. Don't worry if you're not an electrical engineer; we'll break down these concepts into bite-sized, easy-to-understand pieces.

We'll start with the basics - what is electricity, and how does it behave? You'll learn about voltage, current, and resistance, the three musketeers of electrical circuits. We'll explore Ohm's Law, the fundamental relationship between these quantities, and see how it applies to real-world radio situations.

As we progress, we'll delve into the differences between AC and DC, understand power in electrical systems, and introduce you to the concepts of capacitance and inductance. These principles form the backbone of how radio waves are generated, transmitted, and received.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid grasp of electrical fundamentals that will serve you well throughout your amateur radio journey. So, let's flip the switch and energize our learning!
