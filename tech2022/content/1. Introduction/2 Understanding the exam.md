# Understanding the Technician License Exam

## Question Pools

The exam questions come from publicly available question pools developed by the [National Conference of Volunteer Examiner Coordinators (NCVEC)](https://ncvec.org). These pools are updated on a regular schedule:

- Technician Class pool: Updated every four years (last updated 2022)
- General Class pool: Updated every four years (last updated 2023)
- Amateur Extra Class pool: Updated every four years (last updated 2024)

The updates are staggered, so only one pool changes each year. This ensures that study materials and exams remain current with evolving technology and regulations.

## The Technician Class Question Pool

Before diving into the study material, it's helpful to understand what you're preparing for. The Technician license exam consists of 35 multiple-choice questions chosen from a pool of about 400 possible questions. To pass, you need to answer 26 questions correctly (74%).

Some key points about the exam:
- All possible questions and their correct answers are publicly available
- Many of the questions simply test your knowledge of terminology or specific numbers you need to remember
- You don't need to be a technical expert to pass - many concepts are practical and straightforward
- Questions are grouped into subelements (major topics) which are in turn grouped into sections (minor topics). Each exam draws one question from each section, so if there is a section you just don't understand you can safely skip that one and still pass the exam!

The exam format means that with focused study, most people can prepare for and pass the test much more quickly than one might expect. While some students have passed by simply memorizing the questions and answers, understanding the material will make you a more confident and capable operator once licensed.

The moral? This exam isn't as difficult as you might think, and with this book you can choose how deeply you want to learn the material while preparing for your license!
